# Conceptual Outline: AI Relationship Counselor Agent/MCP

## 1. Vision

To develop an AI agent or system (potentially termed a Master Control Program - MCP) that acts as a faith-based relationship counselor, leveraging the structured data in the `faith-based-relationships-ai` repository. The agent will provide guidance, support, and insights based primarily on Christian doctrine and principles.

## 2. Core Capabilities (Counselor Mode)

The AI counselor should aim to simulate aspects of a human counseling session, focusing on:

*   **Empathetic Listening & Understanding:**
    *   Processing user input (text-based initially) to understand their situation, concerns, and emotions.
    *   Responding with empathetic and validating language.
    *   Using techniques like paraphrasing and asking clarifying questions (drawing inspiration from `COUNSEL_COMM_ACTIVE_LISTENING`).
*   **Issue Identification & Framing:**
    *   Identifying key relationship issues or themes based on user input (e.g., communication breakdown, conflict patterns, forgiveness struggles, differing expectations).
    *   Connecting these issues to relevant topics and concepts within the data repository (e.g., mapping user descriptions to `topic` or `keywords`).
*   **Principle Application & Guidance:**
    *   Retrieving relevant principles, scripture, or advice from the structured data based on the identified issues.
    *   Presenting this information clearly and contextually (using `content_summary` and `content_detailed`).
    *   Explaining concepts like the Four Loves (`THEO_CSLEWIS_FOUR_LOVES`), conflict styles (`PRACT_REL_CONFLICT_STYLES`), or the meaning of "one flesh" (`SCRPT_GEN_2_24_ONE_FLESH`).
*   **Reflection & Exploration:**
    *   Guiding users through reflection exercises based on counseling principles or scripture.
    *   Asking open-ended questions to encourage self-discovery and application of principles.
    *   Potentially using `qa_pairs` or `instruction_response` formats to structure interactions.
*   **Scriptural Encouragement & Perspective:**
    *   Offering relevant scripture (`related_scripture`) for comfort, guidance, and perspective.
    *   Connecting practical advice back to its biblical foundations.
*   **Goal Setting & Action Planning (Basic):**
    *   Helping users identify potential next steps or actions based on the discussed principles (e.g., practicing active listening, initiating a conversation about forgiveness).
*   **Ethical Boundaries & Safety:**
    *   Recognizing limitations and avoiding definitive diagnoses or replacing professional human counseling.
    *   Implementing safeguards to detect and respond appropriately to crisis situations (e.g., providing resources for abuse, mental health emergencies).
    *   Maintaining user privacy and data security.

## 3. Potential Architecture & Technology

A possible approach could involve a combination of techniques:

*   **Core Engine:** A Large Language Model (LLM) capable of natural language understanding and generation (e.g., models like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, or open-source alternatives).
*   **Knowledge Base:** The `faith-based-relationships-ai` repository serves as the primary, curated knowledge base.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
    *   User input is analyzed to identify key themes/topics.
    *   A retrieval system searches the JSON data files (potentially indexed using vector embeddings of `content_summary`, `content_detailed`, or `keywords`) for the most relevant entries.
    *   The retrieved data entries (or relevant parts) are provided as context to the LLM along with the user query.
    *   The LLM generates a response grounded in the provided context, ensuring faithfulness to the repository's content.
*   **Fine-Tuning (Optional/Advanced):** The core LLM could potentially be fine-tuned on the structured data (especially `qa_pairs` and `instruction_response`) to improve its ability to respond in a counseling style and accurately reflect the dataset's nuances.
*   **Conversational Management:** A layer to manage dialogue flow, maintain context over turns, handle user intents (asking questions, seeking advice, expressing feelings), and manage the agent's persona (empathetic, wise, faith-based counselor).
*   **Agentic Loop (MCP Concept):** For more complex interactions, an agentic loop could be implemented where the AI: plans its response strategy, retrieves relevant information, generates potential responses, reflects on their appropriateness/helpfulness/safety, and then delivers the final response. This allows for more deliberate and multi-step reasoning.
*   **Interface:** Initially text-based (e.g., chat interface), potentially expanding to voice later.

## 4. Data Utilization Strategy

The structured JSON data is key:

*   `entry_id`, `topic`, `sub_topic`, `keywords`: Used for indexing and retrieval.
*   `content_summary`, `content_detailed`: Provide the core knowledge for the LLM context and response generation.
*   `source_reference`, `related_scripture`: Allow the AI to cite sources and provide scriptural backing.
*   `qa_pairs`: Can be used directly for simple Q&A, for fine-tuning, or as examples for few-shot prompting in RAG.
*   `instruction_response`: Useful for fine-tuning or few-shot prompting for specific task formats.
*   `related_entries`: Enable the AI to navigate between connected concepts, providing more comprehensive explanations.
*   `metadata`: Can inform the AI about the source and status of information (though `moderation_status` is primarily for the contribution workflow).

## 5. Next Steps (Conceptual)

1.  Refine the specific capabilities and scope of the Counselor Mode.
2.  Select specific LLM(s) and RAG framework/tools.
3.  Develop a robust indexing and retrieval strategy for the JSON data.
4.  Build a prototype RAG system for basic Q&A and advice retrieval.
5.  Design and implement the conversational management layer.
6.  Iteratively test, evaluate (for accuracy, empathy, safety, theological alignment), and refine the system.
7.  Explore fine-tuning options if necessary.
8.  Continuously expand and improve the underlying data repository.

This outline provides a starting point for the significant development effort required to build the envisioned AI counselor agent/MCP.
