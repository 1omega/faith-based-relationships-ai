    "content_summary": "Active listening is a communication technique requiring the listener to fully concentrate, understand, respond, and remember what is being said. It involves paying attention non-verbally (eye contact, posture) and verbally (summarizing, asking clarifying questions, reflecting feelings) to show empathy and ensure understanding.",
    "content_detailed": "Active listening is crucial for healthy relationships and effective counseling, aligning with Christian values of empathy, understanding, and valuing others (Philippians 2:3-4, James 1:19). It goes beyond simply hearing words; it involves a conscious effort to understand the complete message being sent. Key components include: 1) **Paying Attention:** Minimizing distractions, maintaining eye contact, and using non-verbal cues (nodding, leaning in) to show engagement. 2) **Showing You Are Listening:** Using verbal affirmations (","uh-huh",", "I see",") and appropriate body language. 3) **Providing Feedback:** Paraphrasing or summarizing the speaker's points to confirm understanding (","So, if I understand correctly, you're feeling...","). 4) **Deferring Judgment:** Avoiding interruption and withholding criticism or advice until the speaker has finished and understanding is confirmed. 5) **Responding Appropriately:** Communicating understanding and empathy, asking clarifying questions respectfully, and sharing your own views thoughtfully once the speaker feels heard. Practicing active listening helps build trust, reduces misunderstandings, resolves conflicts, and demonstrates Christ-like love and care.",
