Available on CD, DVD, MP3 & MP4\nhttp://bit.ly/KCSLOM\n\nIn this teaching, Dr. Munroe details specific laws for successful marriages the way God intended it to be. He speaks on how husband and a wife should position themselves to properly function in the roles God ordained for them. Your names are directed at birth. Your titles are earned. Marriage is not a name, it is a title. You must earn it. Marriage is not a right, it is a privilege. Marriage is not for children, it is for adults. Marriage is not an event, it is a process. Marriage is not a contract, it is a covenant.\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/MunroeGlobalFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/MunroeGlobalTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/MunroeGlobalInsta\n\n#mylesmunroe #drmylesmunroe",
