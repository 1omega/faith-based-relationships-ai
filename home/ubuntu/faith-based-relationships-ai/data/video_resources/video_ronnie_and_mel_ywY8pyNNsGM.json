  "content_summary": "As a Christian, you've probably heard about needing boundaries in dating, but how about with people of the opposite sex in general? Any Christian relationship advice should tell you, If you are single or even if you are married, it is important to establish what is okay and what is not okay with friends, coworkers, girls, or guys of the opposite gender.  \n\nIf you are single, boundaries help keep you from temptation with the opposite sex by guarding your heart and staying pure before God in every area of your life. And as a married couple, boundaries help keep your hearts only on the Lord and on your spouse. \n\nSo join Ronnie and Mel in this video where we talk through having Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual, Communication, and time boundaries with men or women of the opposite sex. We want to guard our own hearts but we also want to fight for purity for our brothers and sisters in Christ!\n\nAlso, be sure to watch our video (linked below) on WHY you need boundaries so you can see what the Bible says about it. And next week we will go into Boundaries in Dating. \n\nHope you enjoy it!\n\nR O N N I E  &  M E L  //  Ronnie Faisst, a freestyle motocross pioneer turned preacher.
