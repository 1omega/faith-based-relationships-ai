  "content_summary": "Christian Relationship Advice: 7 Tips for an Amazing Marriage or Dating Relationship. \n\nThere are so many things that could be said when covering a huge topic like \u201cChristian Relationship Advice.\u201d Here are just 7 of the top Christian principles I believe can help your marriage or dating relationship.\n\n1. How You Treat Her/Him Is a Reflection of Your Relationship With God\n\nIf you don\u2019t know God, you don\u2019t know true love. And if you don\u2019t know true love, you won\u2019t be able to show true love.  1 John 4:20-21 explains:\n\nIf anyone says, \u201cI love God,\u201d and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. 21 And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.\u201d\n\nChristian relationship advice: Therefore if you want to love well in relationships as a Christian, you need a healthy relationship with God first.\n\n2. How He/She Treats You Is a Reflection of Their Relationship with God\n\nJust as you will not be able to love and serve people well without staying connected to Christ, other people will not be able to love you well if their walk with God is not going well. If someone is showing you beautiful examples of sacrificial love, it is because they are having rich, daily encounters with the God who is love.\n\nChristian relationship advice: It\u2019s not about you! Even when your spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend is taking it on you, God is still the main variable in the equation of a healthy relationship.\n\n3. Show Him/Her Grace Like God Gives You Grace\n\nA relationship will only be as healthy as the hearts of those involved. Therefore, you will never have lasting, good relationships, no matter what advice you are following, if you do not have an abundance of grace for other people.\n\nChristian relationship advice: Give your significant other the grace God gives you.\n\n4. Ask Questions and Listen More\n\nThe Lord listens to us, and if want to love others well and have great relationships, we need to slow down and actually listen to what other people are saying:\n\n\u201cI love the Lord, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. 2 Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.\u201d (Psalm 116:1-2)\n\nChristian relationship advice: Your significant other will love being around you if you are good listener.\n\n5. Don\u2019t Try to Turn Her/Him Into Your Minion\n\n In Acts 20:35, Paul said: \"In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, \u2018It is more blessed to give than to receive.\u2019\u201d\n\nChristian relationship advice: People know when you are just using them. If you want to be appreciated, give your significant other a reason to appreciate you.\n\n6. Value Diversity, Don\u2019t Try to Turn Your Significant Other Into Your Own Image\n\nAnother sinful tendency humans have is to try to turn those they are in relationship with into their own image. When a husband and wife argue, sometimes one of them is right and the other is wrong. But most times the argument is simply an effort to turn the other person into their own image.\n\nChristian relationship advice: Help your spouse or girlfriend/boyfriend express the image of Christ through their unique personhood. Don\u2019t try to turn people into your own image, making doctrines out of your personal preferences.\n\n7. Accept the Things that Won\u2019t Change About Him/Her and Respond Accordingly\n\nSigns of maturity are awareness and acceptance. Denial is always the foundation for a slow and painful relationship death.\nIf someone you love and are in relationship has something about them that you wish would change but it just isn\u2019t, you have to have awareness on when to stop pushing and just accept that part about him or her for right now. Plus, sometimes people refuse to change even more when we try to force them to.\n\nWe only have control over ourselves. Therefore, if someone is not changing, you have to accept it and respond accordingly. If you are married, you will just need to learn to deal with your spouse\u2019s flaws in your own way through the grace of God. If you are in a dating relationship with this person, perhaps this means you need to end the relationship. Or perhaps you just need to let it go and accept that their negative character trait is just something you will need to overcome yourself whenever it comes up.\n\nChristian relationship advice: Be mature enough to know what is and is not going to change in the relationship and take responsibility for the only thing you truly have control over \u2013 yourself.\n\nFull article: http://applygodsword.com/christian-relationship-advice-my-top-7-tips-for-marriages-and-dating-relationships/\n\nFREE eBook: The Ultimate Guide to Christian Singleness: http://applygodsword.com/christian-singleness-bible-study-book/\n\n#ChristianRelationshipAdvice #FunnyDatingAdvice #ChristianDatingTips #ChristianRelationshipTips #ChristianMarriageTips #ChristianVlog",
