    "content_detailed": "Question:\nHow do you plan to sustain intimacy throughout your relationships?\n\nRelevant Faith-Based Principles:\n- Marital Intimacy: A depth of mutual knowledge and affection between husband and wife, enjoying shared experiences, emotions, ideas, and sexual romance.\n\n- Resilience: Intimacy helps marriages weather small slights, oversights, inconveniences, poorly chosen words, clashes, and sins against one another.\n\n- Picture of Christ & Church: Emotional, intellectual, experiential, and sexual intimacy reflects and expresses the intimate love between Christ and his people (Eph 5:28-31). Christ \"nourishes and cherishes\" the church; husbands should love wives as their own bodies; they become \"one flesh.\"\n\n- Busyness: Lack of significant time together prevents going deep beneath the surface. Work, chores, church, kids' activities fill time.\n\n- Lack of Effort: Intimacy requires effort, energy, focus, and attention. It's not effortless or magical. Requires considering/studying one's spouse (Heb 10:24 - consider one another).\n\n- Selfishness: Intimacy requires time, work, vulnerability, and sacrifice. It's easier to avoid these costs, especially when tired or pursuing other desires.\n\n- Ignorance: Not knowing *how* to cultivate intimacy, lacking models or maps to explore another's heart beyond functional conversations.\n\n- Insecurity: Past hurts lead to walling off emotional areas for self-protection.\n\n- Lack of Forgiveness: Unaddressed hurt leads to resentment, suspicion, and accumulated bitterness, undercutting intimacy.\n\n- Vision: See and celebrate intimacy as a precious goal, reflecting Christ's love for the church.\n\n- Source (God): Ask God for help; He is glorified by intimate marriages. Pray for intimacy.\n\n- Pursue Jesus: Deepen intimacy with Jesus first; He is the source of love needed for marital intimacy.\n\n- Effort & Time: Intentionally make time and invest effort in knowing and loving your spouse.\n\n- Address Obstacles: Actively work against selfishness, ignorance, insecurity, and unforgiveness.",
