    "content_detailed": "Question:\nWhat could I do or change to help you feel more comfortable sharing even more honestly and openly with me?\n\nRelevant Faith-Based Principles:\n- Nature of Trust: Trust creates safety, security, and deeper love. It allows spouses to be \"careless\" (free of concern) and vulnerable, not self-protective.\n\n- Trustworthiness is Earned: Trust isn't unconditional; you must *be* trustworthy to receive trust (John 10:37 - Jesus submitted to this test). Ask your spouse how you affect them and where you may not be trustworthy (e.g., being critical, harsh, not delivering on promises).\n\n- Trust and Truth: Trust and truth are linked. Deception (even \"white lies\") is the biggest trust killer. Be honest about actions, conversations, finances, etc.\n\n- Rebuilding Trust:\n\n- Outcome: Trust can be built and rebuilt, leading to intimacy from security in each other's love.\n\n- Importance: Trust takes time, intentionality, and effort to develop and guard. Marriages thrive on trust.\n\n- Exclusivity: Marriage involves a promise of exclusivity (\"forsaking all others\"). While extreme exclusivity can replace God (warning from Vanauken), preserving trust within the marriage boundary is vital.\n\n- Three Postures for Cultivating Trust:\n\n- Foundation: All three postures build trust, which is foundational for a thriving marriage reflecting God's design.\n\n- Biblical Standard: James 1:19 provides a standard: \"Let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.\"\n\n- Attentiveness: God calls Christians to be attentive to one another in marriage â€“ to stop, listen, and learn about each other through communication.\n\n- Understanding Differences: Men and women think and respond differently. Ignoring this can lead to misunderstanding, resentment, alienation, anger, and anxiety.\n\n- Goal of Closeness: True closeness requires a willingness to ask questions and reveal oneself.\n\n- Conflict is Inevitable: Conflict happens even in Christian marriages.\n\n- Conflict as Opportunity: Conflict can reveal deep feelings and meanings. It can be used beneficially if the couple agrees they are on the same team and not fighting each other.\n\n- Spouse is Not the Enemy: Remember during conflict that your spouse is not the enemy. Avoid speaking painful/damaging words or letting anger isolate.\n\n- Active Listening: Intentional, active listening is crucial, especially during conflict.\n\n- God's Help: Marriage brings different people together; rely on God to teach how to communicate His love in a way that honors each other and glorifies Him.\n\n- Prayer: Pray for open communication and wisdom in using communication and conflict constructively.\n\n- Unity & Purpose: Marriage involves deep spiritual/physical unity (\"one-fleshness\" - Gen 2:24, Eph 5:31) despite differences. The unified purpose is to worship God, become Christ-like, and reflect Christ's relationship with the church. Effective communication is essential for this.\n\n- Other-Centered Union: God designed marriage as an other-centered union in a me-centered world. Reminders include: it's a loyal partnership, foundation for family, designed for intimacy through sexual expression, and mirrors God's covenant.\n\n- Verbal & Non-Verbal: Communication is both verbal and non-verbal (facial expressions, gestures, tone, eye contact, touch). Non-verbal cues support or contradict words. Be aware of *how* you say things and your body language.\n\n- Internal Barriers:\n\n- External Barriers: Life circumstances change (children, work, finances, aging parents, health issues). Stress reduces time, energy, and desire for communication. Familiarity can breed contempt as flaws become apparent.\n\n- Hope in the Gospel: The gospel provides hope to overcome sinful nature and communicate well despite differences and difficulties.\n\n- #1 Secret: Selflessness: The key to effective communication and a good marriage is selflessness, following Christ's example (John 15:13, 1 Cor 10:24, Eph 5:21-33). Mutual selflessness is required.",
