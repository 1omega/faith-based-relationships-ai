    "content_detailed": "Question:\nWhat would help help strengthen and deepen your trust even more with me?\n\nRelevant Faith-Based Principles:\n- Nature of Trust: Trust creates safety, security, and deeper love. It allows spouses to be \"careless\" (free of concern) and vulnerable, not self-protective.\n\n- Trustworthiness is Earned: Trust isn't unconditional; you must *be* trustworthy to receive trust (John 10:37 - Jesus submitted to this test). Ask your spouse how you affect them and where you may not be trustworthy (e.g., being critical, harsh, not delivering on promises).\n\n- Trust and Truth: Trust and truth are linked. Deception (even \"white lies\") is the biggest trust killer. Be honest about actions, conversations, finances, etc.\n\n- Rebuilding Trust:\n\n- Outcome: Trust can be built and rebuilt, leading to intimacy from security in each other's love.\n\n- Importance: Trust takes time, intentionality, and effort to develop and guard. Marriages thrive on trust.\n\n- Exclusivity: Marriage involves a promise of exclusivity (\"forsaking all others\"). While extreme exclusivity can replace God (warning from Vanauken), preserving trust within the marriage boundary is vital.\n\n- Three Postures for Cultivating Trust:\n\n- Foundation: All three postures build trust, which is foundational for a thriving marriage reflecting God's design.",
