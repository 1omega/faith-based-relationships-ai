    "content_summary": "C.S. Lewis identifies four main types of love: Storge (affection, especially familial), Philia (friendship), Eros (romantic or erotic love), and Agape (unconditional, divine, charitable love). He argues that the first three are natural loves which are good but can become corrupted or idolatrous if not informed and perfected by Agape, God's love.",
    "content_detailed": "In \"The Four Loves,\" C.S. Lewis explores the nature of love by categorizing it into four Greek terms. 1) Storge: This is affection, the comfortable, familiar love often found in families between parents and children, or even towards pets or familiar places. It is humble and arises naturally. 2) Philia: This is the love of friendship, based on shared interests, values, and companionship. Lewis considered it highly valuable, a bond between souls united in a common pursuit or vision. 3) Eros: This is romantic or passionate love, the state of being \"in love.\" While often associated with sexuality, Lewis distinguishes Eros itself from mere lust (Venus). Eros desires the beloved individual intensely. 4) Agape: This is unconditional, selfless, divine love, modeled on God's love for humanity. It is not dependent on the lovability of the object but is a love that gives and sacrifices without expecting return. Lewis posits that the natural loves (Storge, Philia, Eros), while gifts from God, are insufficient on their own and prone to distortion. They need Agape (God's grace and charity) to guide, purify, and elevate them, preventing them from becoming selfish or idolatrous. Agape enables loving others rightly and keeps the natural loves in their proper place.",
