_Introduction_

The articles that are printed in this book made what was in my opinion
the most important, the most constructive, series on a single subject
that _Good Housekeeping_ has published in the quarter century and more
that I was its editor. And they might so easily never have been
written--just a little item in a newspaper missed, or its significance
overlooked, and these sincere and helpful articles would still be locked
up in the minds and hearts of the men and women who wrote them.

For it all happened just like that. Students in one of the larger
California universities asked that a course in marriage relations be
given--and a New York newspaper heralded it with a stick of type over
about page 10. Somehow the item impressed me deeply. Here were thousands
of students of both sexes, thinking of marriage, physically impelled
toward marriage, admitting that they wanted more information about
marriage before undertaking it. Add to these students the hundreds of
thousands in other colleges and to them the millions of young men and
young women outside of college--and there was Youth itself, visioning
marriage as the Great Adventure, which no one should miss, but about
which there were grave reports.

I have heard lots about Youth in recent years--its lackadaisical attitude
toward all serious things, its tendency to look the moral code straight
in the eye and smash it, its belief that chastity isn't worth its cost or
success in marriage worth working for. And I had disbelieved much that I
had heard, it having been my privilege to work with and for young people
in high school and college over a long period of years. I knew that Youth
is looking for something better than it is being given in either precept
or example. And so this request of a group of college young people seemed
to me to be both a challenge and an opportunity. I accepted the
challenge. The next step was to find out how best to meet it. It seemed
to me that to offer our young people anything less than the best that I
could get would be letting them down. So I turned for advice to several
college men who had made a long study of the problems involved in
marriage, and from the various lists of subjects and authors
suggested--adding a few of my own--selected the group now presented in
permanent form in this book.

If these articles make success in marriage seem something that must
constantly be worked for, they at the same time show that success, plus
the happiness that goes with it, can be achieved. Which is all, I think,
that any man or woman has a right to ask for.

Foreword

If by some strange chance, not a vestige of us descended to the remote
future save a pile of our schoolbooks or some examination papers, we may
imagine how puzzled an antiquarian of the period would be on finding in
them no indication that the learners were ever likely to be parents. "This
must have been the curriculum for their celibates," we may fancy him
concluding. "I perceive here an elaborate preparation for many things;
especially for reading the books of extinct nations and of coexisting
nations (from which, indeed, it seems clear that these people had very
little worth reading in their own tongue); but I find no reference
whatever to the bringing up of children. They could not have been so
absurd as to omit all training for this gravest of responsibilities.
Evidently, then, this was the school course of one of their monastic
orders."

HERBERT SPENCER

This quotation from the pen of Herbert Spencer arrested our attention
this winter when we were reading a number of books dealing with various
epoch-making periods in the development of educational method and theory.
We closed the book and pondered over the inferences made by this leader
and we began to speculate on what an antiquarian of the present period
might say of our textbooks, our curricula, and our examination papers. We
hope in his search that it might be his good fortune to unearth the
syllabi of some of our courses on Education for Marriage and Family Life,
some of the worthwhile literature which is being written on the subject,
even perhaps the _Good Housekeeping Marriage Book_. If these happened to
be the only remaining record of the period, we might fancy him
concluding, "Ah, what an enlightened people there must have been in the
twentieth century. I perceive here preparation for real life problems.
This must have been a school course for all the Youth of that
generation."

This volume represents a definite step in the advancement of this ideal.
We wish to express to Dr. William F. Bigelow, former Editor of _Good
Housekeeping_, our sincere appreciation for the kindly way in which he
received the idea of publishing these valuable articles in permanent form
and his readiness to help in every way possible in carrying this idea
through to completion.

To each author we wish to express our gratitude for the important
contribution he has made, not only in giving new interpretation and new
meaning to the institution of marriage, but also for rendering valuable
assistance in the solution of many of the problems which confront the
Youth of today as they approach this most challenging, most demanding,
most satisfying and most rewarding of Life's experiences.

CHAPTER ONE

_When He Comes A-Courting_

Never were young people so perplexed about courtship as they are today.
They are puzzled because they have lost the clear guidance that custom
formerly provided. Courtship used to be a formal undertaking, hedged
about by restrictions and chaperonage. Now it is largely a matter of
individual choice and conduct. This freedom brings new opportunities but
also new risks.

The purpose of courtship is, or should be, to discover whether two people
are suited to each other for a lifelong partnership in marriage. It is a
period of testing, of mutual exploration, of finding out whether physical
attraction is matched by compatibility of temperament, interests, and
ideals.

What should young people look for during courtship?

1.  **Character:** Is the person honest, reliable, kind, considerate?
    Character is the foundation of any lasting relationship. Look beyond
    superficial charm to the underlying qualities.

2.  **Compatibility:** Do you enjoy each other's company? Do you share
    common interests and values? Do you have similar ideas about life,
    money, children, religion? Absolute agreement is not necessary or
    even desirable, but there should be a fundamental harmony.

3.  **Emotional Maturity:** Is the person able to handle disagreements
    constructively? Are they overly dependent, jealous, or possessive?
    Can they give and receive affection freely? Emotional maturity is
    crucial for navigating the ups and downs of married life.

4.  **Family Background:** What kind of family does the person come from?
    While not definitive, family background often reveals patterns of
    behaviour and attitudes towards marriage and family life.

5.  **Physical Attraction:** While not the most important factor, mutual
    physical attraction is a normal and healthy part of courtship and
    marriage. However, it should not be the sole basis for the
    relationship.

Courtship is also a time for self-discovery. How do you react in this
relationship? Does it bring out the best in you? Do you feel comfortable
being yourself?

Modern courtship often involves a degree of physical intimacy. This is a
delicate matter. While some expression of affection is natural, rushing
into excessive intimacy can cloud judgment and obscure the more important
aspects of compatibility. The wise couple will exercise restraint and
focus on building a broad foundation for their relationship, not just a
physical one.

Honesty is paramount in courtship. Be honest with yourself about your
feelings and observations. Be honest with your partner about your past (to
the extent that it is relevant), your expectations, and your concerns.
Deception or withholding important information during courtship is a poor
start to a marriage.

Don't rush. Courtship takes time. It's better to prolong courtship and be
sure, or even break off an unsuitable relationship, than to rush into a
marriage that is likely to fail.

Seek advice if needed, from trusted family members, friends, or
professional counselors. But ultimately, the decision is yours. Choose
wisely, for courtship is the gateway to marriage, and the choices made
during this time will profoundly affect future happiness.




_Dr. James L. McConaughy_

CHAPTER TWO

_Now That You Are Engaged_

Engagement is more than just a romantic interlude; it is a crucial period
of preparation for marriage. It is a time to deepen understanding, make
practical plans, and confirm the decision to build a life together.

What should an engaged couple focus on?

1.  **Deepening Understanding:** Continue the process of mutual discovery
    begun in courtship. Discuss your hopes, fears, values, and
    expectations regarding marriage, children, careers, finances, and
    lifestyle. Talk openly about potential areas of conflict and how you
    might handle them.

2.  **Practical Planning:**
    *   **Finances:** Discuss your financial situations honestly. How will
        you manage money? Will you have joint or separate accounts? What
        are your attitudes towards saving, spending, and debt? Create a
        budget.
    *   **Living Arrangements:** Where will you live? What kind of home do
        you envision?
    *   **Careers:** How will your respective careers fit into your married
        life? If both plan to work, how will household responsibilities
        be shared?
    *   **In-laws:** Discuss your relationships with your respective
        families and how you will navigate potential in-law issues.
    *   **Wedding Plans:** Plan the wedding together, keeping it within
        your means and reflecting your shared values. Don't let wedding
        preparations overshadow the more important task of preparing for
        marriage itself.

3.  **Health:** Both partners should have a thorough medical examination,
    including tests for any potential health issues that could affect the
    marriage or future children. Discuss any health concerns openly.

4.  **Building Shared Experiences:** Continue to spend quality time
    together, engaging in activities you both enjoy. Also, experience
    different situations together--handle a minor crisis, work on a
    project, spend time with each other's families and friends. This
    helps reveal how you function as a team.

5.  **Addressing Doubts:** Engagement is the last chance to reconsider.
    Don't ignore persistent doubts or serious disagreements. It is far
    better to break an engagement than to enter into an unhappy marriage.
    Seeking premarital counseling can be very helpful in exploring doubts
    or resolving conflicts.

Engagement should be a time of joy and anticipation, but also one of
serious preparation. Use this period wisely to build a strong foundation
for a happy and lasting marriage.




_Dr. Ellsworth Huntington_

CHAPTER THREE

_Ought I to Marry?_

This question involves two distinct aspects: first, whether marriage in
general is desirable for an individual, and second, whether marriage to a
_specific_ person is advisable.

**Is Marriage Desirable in General?**

For the vast majority of people, marriage is a natural and fulfilling
state. It offers companionship, emotional security, the opportunity for
intimate love and sexual expression, and the potential joy of raising a
family. Statistically, married people tend to live longer, be healthier,
and report higher levels of happiness than single people.

However, marriage is not necessarily the right path for everyone. Some
individuals may be better suited to a single life due to temperament,
career demands, or a lack of desire for the commitments marriage entails.
There should be no social stigma attached to choosing not to marry.

The decision depends on individual personality, goals, and circumstances.
Consider:

*   **Desire for Companionship:** Do you deeply desire a lifelong partner?
*   **Capacity for Intimacy:** Are you capable of deep emotional connection
    and commitment?
*   **Desire for Family:** Do you wish to have children?
*   **Willingness to Compromise:** Are you prepared for the give-and-take
    that marriage requires?

**Should I Marry This Specific Person?**

This is the more critical question. Love is essential, but it is not
enough. Compatibility, shared values, and mutual respect are equally
important. Ask yourself:

*   **Do we share fundamental values and life goals?** Disagreements on
    core issues (religion, children, finances, ethics) can create
    intractable conflict.
*   **Are we compatible temperamentally?** Can you live comfortably with
    each other's personalities, habits, and moods?
*   **Do we communicate well?** Can you discuss problems openly and resolve
    disagreements constructively?
*   **Do we respect each other?** Do you admire your partner's character
    and abilities? Do they respect yours?
*   **Is there mutual trust?**
*   **Is the physical attraction strong and likely to endure?**
*   **Do our families and friends generally approve?** While not decisive,
    strong opposition from those who know you well should be carefully
    considered.
*   **Are there any serious warning signs?** (e.g., addiction, abuse,
    chronic dishonesty, severe emotional instability). These issues must
    be addressed _before_ marriage, not hoped away.

**Heredity and Health:**

Consider the health and hereditary background of both partners. Are there
any serious hereditary diseases or conditions that could affect future
children? Consulting with a doctor or genetic counselor may be advisable.
While not necessarily a barrier to marriage, potential health issues
should be understood and discussed openly.

**Timing:**

Are you both mature enough for marriage? Rushing into marriage at a very
young age, before personalities are fully formed and education/careers are
established, increases the risk of failure. Financial stability is also a
practical consideration.

Ultimately, the decision to marry a specific person should be based on a
combination of love, rational assessment, and deep inner conviction. It
is one of the most important decisions in life; make it thoughtfully and
honestly.




_Eleanor Roosevelt_

CHAPTER FOUR

_Should Wives Work?_

This question, once highly controversial, is becoming increasingly common.
Whether a wife should work outside the home depends entirely on the
individuals involved and their specific circumstances. There is no single
right answer.

**Arguments for Wives Working:**

1.  **Financial Necessity:** In many families, two incomes are needed to
    maintain a desired standard of living or simply to make ends meet.
2.  **Personal Fulfillment:** Many women have careers they find stimulating
    and rewarding. Denying them the opportunity to work can lead to
    frustration and resentment. Using one's talents and education can be
    a source of self-esteem and personal growth.
3.  **Independence:** Earning her own income gives a wife a degree of
    financial independence and a greater sense of partnership in the
    marriage.
4.  **Broader Interests:** Working outside the home can keep a wife more
    engaged with the world, bringing new perspectives and interests into
    the marriage.
5.  **Contribution to Society:** Women have valuable skills and talents
    that can benefit society through professional work.

**Arguments Against (or Challenges of) Wives Working:**

1.  **Childcare:** The primary concern is often the care of young children.
    Finding adequate and affordable childcare can be difficult. Some
    believe that young children thrive best with a parent's full-time
    care, especially in the early years.
2.  **Household Management:** Combining a job with household chores and
    responsibilities can be exhausting, leading to stress and fatigue (the
    "second shift").
3.  **Strain on Marriage:** If roles and responsibilities are not clearly
    defined and shared, or if one partner resents the other's career, it
    can create tension in the marriage.
4.  **Husband's Attitude:** Some husbands may feel threatened by a wife's
    career success or feel their role as primary provider is undermined.
5.  **Societal Expectations:** Despite changes, some societal pressure may
    still exist for women to prioritize home and family over career.

**Making the Decision:**

The decision should be made jointly by the husband and wife, considering:

*   **Financial Situation:** Is the wife's income necessary?
*   **Presence and Age of Children:** What are the childcare needs and
    options? How will the children's well-being be ensured?
*   **Wife's Desire and Aptitude:** Does she want to work? Is her work
    fulfilling?
*   **Husband's Attitude:** Is he supportive? Are both willing to adjust
    roles and share responsibilities?
*   **Practicalities:** Can household tasks be managed effectively? Is
    reliable childcare available?

**If the Wife Works:**

Success requires cooperation and flexibility:

*   **Shared Responsibility:** Household chores and childcare must be shared
    fairly. This requires a true partnership approach.
*   **Efficient Management:** Good organization and time management are
    essential.
*   **Quality Time:** Make a conscious effort to preserve quality time for
    each other and for the children.
*   **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust arrangements as circumstances
    change (e.g., birth of a child, job change, illness).

Ultimately, the goal is to find an arrangement that works best for the
specific couple and family, promoting the well-being and happiness of all
members. Whether the wife works outside the home or focuses her energies
within it, her contribution is valuable and should be respected.




_Gladys Hoagland Groves_

CHAPTER FIVE

_Learning to Live Together_

The first year of marriage is often the most challenging. It is a period
of adjustment, where two individuals, often with different backgrounds,
habits, and expectations, learn to merge their lives into a functioning
partnership.

**Key Areas of Adjustment:**

1.  **Daily Habits:** Seemingly small things--neatness vs. messiness,
    punctuality vs. tardiness, morning person vs. night owl--can cause
    friction if not handled with tolerance and compromise.
2.  **Money Management:** Moving from individual finances to joint finances
    requires open communication and agreement on spending priorities,
    saving goals, and budgeting.
3.  **Social Life:** How much time will be spent with friends (jointly and
    separately)? How will social obligations be balanced?
4.  **In-laws:** Establishing appropriate boundaries and relationships with
    both sets of parents requires tact and mutual support between the
    spouses.
5.  **Sex:** Physical intimacy requires communication, sensitivity, and a
    willingness to understand and meet each other's needs and desires.
    Initial adjustments are common and should be approached with patience
    and openness.
6.  **Communication:** Learning to communicate effectively--expressing needs
    and feelings clearly, listening actively, and resolving disagreements
    constructively--is perhaps the most critical skill for marital
    success.
7.  **Roles and Responsibilities:** Deciding who does what around the
    house, especially if both partners work, requires negotiation and a
    fair division of labour.

**Strategies for Successful Adjustment:**

*   **Realistic Expectations:** Don't expect perfection from yourself or
    your partner. Marriage involves challenges and requires effort.
*   **Communication:** Talk openly and honestly about everything, including
    difficult subjects. Listen respectfully to your partner's perspective.
*   **Compromise:** Be willing to meet each other halfway. Marriage is not
    about winning arguments but about finding solutions that work for both.
*   **Tolerance and Patience:** Accept minor differences and annoyances.
    Give each other space and time to adjust.
*   **Mutual Respect:** Value your partner's opinions, feelings, and
    individuality.
*   **Affection:** Continue to express love and appreciation through words
    and actions.
*   **Shared Fun:** Make time for activities you both enjoy to keep the
    romance and connection alive.
*   **Seek Help if Needed:** Don't hesitate to seek guidance from trusted
    friends, family, clergy, or professional counselors if you encounter
    persistent problems.

Learning to live together is an ongoing process, not just confined to the
first year. By approaching adjustments with love, patience, and a spirit
of cooperation, couples can build a strong and resilient partnership that
deepens over time.

CHAPTER SIX

_Marriage Makes the Money Go_

Financial adjustments are a major part of early marriage. Combining
incomes (or adjusting to one), setting up a household, and managing joint
expenses requires careful planning and open communication.

**Common Financial Challenges:**

1.  **Differing Attitudes:** Spouses often come from families with
    different approaches to money (savers vs. spenders, budgeters vs.
    impulsive buyers). These differing attitudes need to be understood and
    reconciled.
2.  **Unexpected Expenses:** Setting up a home often costs more than
    anticipated. Emergencies and unforeseen expenses can strain a tight
    budget.
3.  **Lack of Planning:** Failing to create a budget or track spending can
    lead to overspending, debt, and financial stress.
4.  **Income Changes:** Adjusting to a single income if the wife stops
    working, or managing fluctuations in income, requires planning.
5.  **Debt:** Bringing pre-existing debts (student loans, credit cards)
    into the marriage needs to be addressed openly.
6.  **Control Issues:** Disagreements over who controls the money or makes
    financial decisions can be a source of conflict.

**Steps to Financial Harmony:**

1.  **Full Disclosure:** Be completely honest with each other about your
    income, assets, debts, and financial habits _before_ marriage.
2.  **Set Goals Together:** Discuss your short-term and long-term financial
    goals (e.g., buying a home, saving for retirement, travel, children's
    education). Shared goals provide motivation for financial discipline.
3.  **Create a Budget:** Track your income and expenses to understand where
    the money is going. Develop a realistic budget that allocates funds
    for necessities, savings, debt repayment, and discretionary spending.
    Review and adjust the budget regularly.
4.  **Decide on a Management System:** How will you handle bank accounts
    and bill payments? Options include:
    *   **Joint Account:** All income goes in, all expenses come out.
        Requires high trust and communication.
    *   **Separate Accounts:** Each manages their own income and contributes
        agreed amounts to joint expenses. Maintains financial autonomy.
    *   **Hybrid System:** A joint account for household expenses, plus
        separate personal accounts for individual spending.
    Choose the system that feels fairest and most comfortable for both
    partners.
5.  **Regular Financial Discussions:** Set aside time regularly (e.g.,
    monthly) to review the budget, discuss upcoming expenses, and check
    progress towards goals. Make financial management a team effort.
6.  **Plan for Emergencies:** Build an emergency fund (typically 3-6
    months of living expenses) to cover unexpected events like job loss or
    medical bills.
7.  **Insurance:** Ensure you have adequate health, life, and property
    insurance.
8.  **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting a financial planner
    for help with budgeting, investing, or complex financial situations.

Money is often cited as a major source of marital conflict, but it doesn't
have to be. By approaching finances as a team, communicating openly, and
planning carefully, couples can achieve financial stability and harmony,
freeing them to focus on other aspects of their life together.




_Jessie Marshall, M. D._

CHAPTER SEVEN

_Children? Of Course!_

For most married couples, the question is not _if_ they will have
children, but _when_ and _how many_. Having children profoundly changes a
marriage and requires significant preparation and adjustment.

**Planning for Parenthood:**

1.  **Mutual Desire:** The decision to have children should be a joint one,
    made when both partners feel ready emotionally, financially, and
    relationally.
2.  **Timing:** Consider factors like age, career stability, financial
    readiness, and the strength of the marital relationship. Many couples
    find it beneficial to have some time together to adjust to marriage
    before starting a family.
3.  **Health:** Both prospective parents should be in good health. Prenatal
    care for the mother is crucial. Discuss any hereditary health concerns
    with a doctor.
4.  **Financial Preparation:** Children are expensive. Estimate the costs
    involved (medical care, housing, food, clothing, childcare, education)
    and adjust your budget accordingly.
5.  **Emotional Readiness:** Are you prepared for the demands of
    parenthood--the sleepless nights, the constant responsibility, the
    changes to your lifestyle and relationship? Discuss your expectations
    and potential fears.
6.  **Knowledge:** Learn about pregnancy, childbirth, and infant care.
    Attend prenatal classes together.

**Adjustments After Baby Arrives:**

Parenthood brings immense joy but also significant stress and change:

*   **Lifestyle Changes:** Spontaneity decreases; life revolves around the
    baby's schedule. Social life changes.
*   **Fatigue:** Sleep deprivation is common in the early months.
*   **Financial Strain:** Expenses increase.
*   **Relationship Dynamics:** Less time and energy for each other. Roles
    shift. Potential for disagreements over parenting styles.
*   **Emotional Rollercoaster:** Joy, love, anxiety, frustration are all
    normal emotions.

**Navigating the Transition:**

*   **Teamwork:** Share childcare and household tasks. Support each other
    emotionally.
*   **Communication:** Keep talking about your feelings, needs, and
    concerns.
*   **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adapt routines and expectations.
*   **Prioritize the Marriage:** Make time for each other, even if it's
    just short periods of focused attention. Nurture your relationship as
    partners, not just as parents.
*   **Seek Support:** Accept help from family and friends. Join parent
    groups. Don't hesitate to seek professional help if experiencing
    significant stress or postpartum depression.
*   **Patience:** Adjusting to parenthood takes time. Be patient with
    yourself, your partner, and your baby.

Having children is one of life's most rewarding experiences, but it
requires conscious effort to maintain a strong marriage amidst the demands
of parenthood. By planning ahead, communicating openly, and working as a
team, couples can navigate the transition successfully and find deep joy
in their growing family.




_Dr. Hornell Hart_

CHAPTER EIGHT

_Detour Around Reno_

Marital conflict is inevitable, but divorce doesn't have to be. Many
marriages that seem headed for failure can be saved and even strengthened
if couples are willing to identify the problems and work actively towards
solutions.

**Common Causes of Marital Conflict:**

*   **Poor Communication:** Misunderstandings, inability to express needs,
    failure to listen, destructive arguing patterns (criticism, contempt,
    defensiveness, stonewalling).
*   **Unmet Emotional Needs:** Lack of affection, appreciation, companionship,
    or support.
*   **Financial Problems:** Disagreements over spending, debt, financial
    goals.
*   **Sexual Difficulties:** Differences in desire, lack of intimacy,
    unresolved issues.
*   **Conflicts over Children:** Disagreements on discipline, values,
    parenting styles.
*   **In-law Interference:** Difficulty setting boundaries with families of
    origin.
*   **External Stressors:** Job loss, illness, relocation, etc.
*   **Unrealistic Expectations:** Believing marriage should always be easy
    or romantic.
*   **Personal Issues:** Unresolved individual problems (e.g., low
    self-esteem, past trauma, mental health issues) spilling over into
    the marriage.

**Strategies for Resolving Conflict and Saving a Marriage:**

1.  **Acknowledge the Problem:** Both partners must recognize that there is
    a problem and be willing to work on it.
2.  **Commitment:** Reaffirm your commitment to the marriage and to finding
    solutions.
3.  **Improve Communication:**
    *   **Schedule Time to Talk:** Set aside regular time for calm discussion
        when you won't be interrupted.
    *   **Use "I" Statements:** Express your feelings and needs without
        blaming (e.g., "I feel hurt when..." instead of "You always...").
    *   **Active Listening:** Pay full attention when your partner is
        speaking. Try to understand their perspective, even if you don't
        agree.
    *   **Focus on the Issue, Not the Person:** Avoid name-calling,
        insults, and dredging up past grievances.
    *   **Take Breaks if Needed:** If discussion becomes too heated, agree
        to take a break and resume when calmer.
4.  **Identify Specific Issues:** Move beyond general complaints to pinpoint
    the specific behaviours or situations causing conflict.
5.  **Brainstorm Solutions:** Work together to find potential solutions that
    address both partners' needs. Be willing to compromise.
6.  **Seek Understanding:** Try to understand the underlying reasons for
    your partner's behaviour or feelings.
7.  **Focus on Positives:** Make an effort to notice and appreciate the good
    things in your relationship. Express affection and appreciation
    regularly.
8.  **Rebuild Trust:** If trust has been broken, rebuilding it takes time,
    consistency, and genuine remorse and forgiveness.
9.  **Seek Professional Help:** Marriage counseling can provide a safe space
    to discuss issues, learn communication skills, and gain new
    perspectives. A trained counselor can guide couples through the
    process of resolving conflict and strengthening their bond.

Saving a marriage requires effort, patience, and a willingness to change
from both partners. It's not always easy, but for couples committed to
each other, navigating difficulties can lead to a deeper, more resilient,
and ultimately more satisfying relationship.

CHAPTER NINE

_Sex Instruction in the Home_

Providing children with accurate and healthy information about sex is a
vital parental responsibility. If parents don't do it, children will pick
up information (often inaccurate or distorted) from peers, the media, or
other sources.

**Why Parents Should Instruct:**

*   **Accuracy:** Ensure children receive correct information.
*   **Values:** Frame information within the family's moral and ethical
    values.
*   **Trust:** Builds openness and trust between parent and child, making it
    more likely the child will come to the parent with future questions or
    concerns.
*   **Healthy Attitudes:** Fosters a positive and respectful attitude
    towards sex and sexuality, free from shame or excessive fear.
*   **Safety:** Equips children with knowledge to protect themselves from
    potential abuse or exploitation.

**When and How to Instruct:**

Sex education is not a single conversation but an ongoing process that
starts early and adapts to the child's age and developmental stage.

1.  **Start Early (Preschool Years):**
    *   Use correct anatomical terms for body parts.
    *   Answer simple questions about where babies come from honestly and
        in age-appropriate terms (e.g., "Babies grow inside a special
        place in the mother's body called the uterus").
    *   Focus on the loving context of family.

2.  **Elementary School Years:**
    *   Explain the basic biological differences between males and females.
    *   Provide more detail about conception, pregnancy, and birth as
        questions arise.
    *   Discuss puberty and the changes it brings _before_ they happen.
    *   Talk about appropriate boundaries and personal safety ("good touch,
        bad touch").

3.  **Adolescence:**
    *   Discuss puberty, menstruation, erections, nocturnal emissions in
        more detail.
    *   Explain sexual intercourse, contraception, and sexually transmitted
        diseases.
    *   Talk about emotional aspects of relationships, love, infatuation,
        and responsible decision-making.
    *   Discuss values related to sexual behaviour, abstinence, and
        readiness for sexual activity.
    *   Address issues like peer pressure, media influences, and online
        safety.

**Tips for Parents:**

*   **Be Approachable:** Create an atmosphere where children feel
    comfortable asking questions without fear of embarrassment or
    punishment.
*   **Be Honest and Direct:** Use clear, simple language. Don't evade
    questions or make up stories.
*   **Answer Questions as They Arise:** Don't wait for a formal "talk."
    Use teachable moments.
*   **Keep it Age-Appropriate:** Provide information the child is ready to
    understand. Don't overwhelm them with too much detail too soon.
*   **It's Okay Not to Know Everything:** If you don't know the answer, say
    so and offer to find out together.
*   **Use Resources:** Utilize age-appropriate books or reputable websites
    to help explain concepts.
*   **Listen More Than You Talk:** Understand your child's concerns and
    perspective.
*   **Focus on Values and Responsibility:** Connect information about sex to
    broader values like respect, love, commitment, and responsibility.
*   **Both Parents Involved:** Ideally, both mother and father should be
    involved in discussions.

Providing sex education may feel awkward at first, but it is one of the
most important gifts parents can give their children--the gift of accurate
knowledge, healthy attitudes, and the foundation for responsible choices.




_William Lyon Phelps_

CHAPTER TEN

_Religion in the Home_

Religion can be a powerful force for good within the family, providing a
moral compass, a source of comfort and strength, shared values, and
meaningful traditions.

**The Role of Religion in Family Life:**

1.  **Moral Foundation:** Religion typically provides a framework of ethical
    principles and values that guide behaviour and decision-making.
    Teaching children right from wrong within a religious context can give
    them a strong moral grounding.
2.  **Shared Values and Beliefs:** A shared faith can unite a family,
    providing common ground, shared rituals, and a sense of belonging to a
    larger community.
3.  **Comfort and Strength:** Religious faith can offer comfort during times
    of sorrow, illness, or difficulty. Prayer and belief in a higher
    power can provide strength and resilience.
4.  **Meaning and Purpose:** Religion often addresses fundamental questions
    about life, death, and purpose, helping family members find meaning
    beyond the everyday.
5.  **Traditions and Rituals:** Religious holidays, ceremonies (like
    baptisms, bar/bat mitzvahs, confirmations), and practices (like
    prayer or attending services) create shared memories and strengthen
    family bonds.
6.  **Community:** Religious institutions often provide a supportive
    community network for families.

**Cultivating Religion in the Home:**

*   **Parental Example:** Children learn most effectively by example. If
    parents live their faith sincerely, children are more likely to embrace
    it.
*   **Open Discussion:** Talk about faith and spiritual matters naturally as
    part of family life. Encourage questions and discussions.
*   **Shared Practices:** Incorporate religious practices that are meaningful
    to your family, such as grace before meals, bedtime prayers, reading
    sacred texts together, or attending religious services.
*   **Teaching:** Explain the core beliefs, stories, and traditions of your
    faith in an age-appropriate manner.
*   **Consistency:** Regular practice is more effective than sporadic
    efforts.
*   **Respect for Differences:** If parents come from different religious
    backgrounds, they need to decide how they will handle religious
    upbringing, ideally finding a path that respects both traditions or
    choosing one to follow consistently. Respect children's developing
    views, even if they differ from the parents'.
*   **Focus on Core Values:** Emphasize the universal values often found in
    religion, such as love, compassion, forgiveness, honesty, and service
    to others.
*   **Avoid Coercion:** Faith should be nurtured, not forced. Aim to inspire
    rather than compel belief.

Whether deeply devout or moderately observant, incorporating spiritual or
religious elements into family life can enrich relationships, provide
guidance, and foster a sense of connection and purpose.

CHAPTER ELEVEN

_It Pays to be Happily Married_

While happiness is its own reward, a successful marriage brings numerous
tangible and intangible benefits that extend far beyond the couple
themselves.

**Benefits for the Couple:**

1.  **Emotional Well-being:** A happy marriage provides companionship,
    love, support, and security, reducing loneliness and stress. Married
    people generally report higher levels of life satisfaction.
2.  **Physical Health:** Studies consistently show that happily married
    people tend to live longer, have fewer chronic illnesses, and recover
    more quickly from sickness or surgery. The emotional support and
    healthier lifestyle habits often associated with stable marriages
    contribute to this.
3.  **Mental Health:** Marriage offers a buffer against depression,
    anxiety, and other mental health issues. Having a supportive partner
    enhances resilience.
4.  **Financial Stability:** Married couples often benefit from pooled
    resources, economies of scale, and greater potential for wealth
    accumulation compared to singles.
5.  **Personal Growth:** A good marriage challenges partners to grow,
    compromise, and develop qualities like patience, empathy, and
    selflessness.

**Benefits for Children:**

1.  **Stable Environment:** Children raised in stable, low-conflict homes
    with happily married parents tend to thrive emotionally, socially, and
    academically.
2.  **Positive Role Models:** They learn about healthy relationships,
    commitment, and conflict resolution by observing their parents.
3.  **Emotional Security:** A loving parental relationship provides a secure
    base from which children can explore the world.
4.  **Better Outcomes:** Research suggests children from intact, happy
    marriages are less likely to experience poverty, behavioural problems,
    substance abuse, or difficulties in their own future relationships.

**Benefits for Society:**

1.  **Social Stability:** Strong families form the bedrock of stable
    communities. Marriage promotes pro-social behaviour and reduces crime
    rates.
2.  **Economic Productivity:** Married individuals, particularly men, tend
    to be more productive economically. Stable families contribute to a
    stronger workforce.
3.  **Reduced Social Costs:** Happy marriages reduce the societal costs
    associated with divorce, single parenthood, crime, and various social
    problems.

Investing time and effort into building and maintaining a happy marriage
is not just a personal pursuit; it yields significant dividends for the
couple, their children, and society as a whole. Happiness in marriage is
not merely a desirable outcome; it is a valuable asset.




_Dr. Ernest R. Groves and Gladys H. Groves_

CHAPTER TWELVE

_The Case for Monogamy_

Monogamy--the union of one man and one woman--has emerged, despite
variations throughout history and across cultures, as the dominant and
most successful form of marriage in Western civilization, and increasingly
worldwide.

**Why Monogamy?**

1.  **Biological Basis:** While human mating patterns are complex, the
    relatively equal sex ratio at birth and the prolonged dependency of
    human children favour pair-bonding for cooperative parenting.
2.  **Emotional Needs:** Monogamy offers the potential for deep emotional
    intimacy, trust, and security that is difficult to achieve in polygamous
    or temporary relationships. It allows for focused commitment and
    undivided affection.
3.  **Child Welfare:** Monogamy generally provides the most stable and
    supportive environment for raising children. It ensures clarity of
    parentage and encourages investment from both parents.
4.  **Social Stability:** Widespread monogamy promotes social order by
    minimizing sexual competition and jealousy, ensuring that most
    individuals have the opportunity to form a stable family unit. Systems
    like polygyny (one man, multiple wives) often leave a surplus of
    unmarried men, potentially leading to social unrest.
5.  **Equality between Sexes:** Monogamy is the only form of marriage that
    allows for true equality between partners. Polygamy inherently involves
    inequality and often treats wives as property or subordinates.
6.  **Personal Development:** The focused commitment and challenges of a
    monogamous relationship foster personal growth, maturity, and the
    development of virtues like loyalty, patience, and selflessness.

**Challenges to Monogamy:**

Monogamy is not without its challenges. Infidelity, boredom, and the
desire for novelty can strain monogamous relationships. The high rates of
divorce in modern societies show that achieving lifelong, happy monogamy
requires significant effort and commitment.

However, these challenges do not invalidate the ideal of monogamy itself.
Rather, they highlight the need for better preparation for marriage,
improved communication skills, and a realistic understanding that lasting
love requires ongoing nurturing.

Alternatives like "open marriage" or serial monogamy (multiple marriages
over a lifetime) often fail to provide the same level of security,
intimacy, and stability for individuals, children, and society.

While individual choices may vary, the evidence from biology, psychology,
and sociology suggests that monogamy, despite its difficulties, remains
the most promising framework for fulfilling the deep human needs for love,
companionship, family, and social order.

from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
