MARRIAGE:
AS IT WAS, AS IT IS, AND AS IT SHOULD BE.


"_Either all human beings have equal rights, or none have any._"

--Condorcet.




I.

MARRIAGE

|The recognition of human rights may be said to be of modern growth, and
even yet they are but very imperfectly understood. Liberty used to be
regarded as a privilege bestowed, instead of as an inherent right; rights
of classes have often been claimed: right to rule, right to tax, right
to punish, all these have been argued for and maintained by force; but
these are not rights, they are only wrongs veiled as legal rights. Jean
Jacques Rousseau struck a new note when he cried: "Men are born free;"
free by birthright was a new thought, when declared as a universal
inheritance, and this "gospel of Jean Jacques Rousseau" dawned on the
world as the sun-rising of a glorious day--a day of human liberty,
unrestrained by class.

In 1789 the doctrine of the "Rights of Man" received its first European
sanction by law; in the August of that year the National Assembly of
France proclaimed: "Men are born, and remain, free and equal in
rights.... The aim of political association is the conservation of the
natural and imprescriptible rights of man; these rights are--liberty,
property, safety, and resistance of tyranny." During savage and
semi-civilised ages these "imprescriptible rights" are never dreamed of
as existing; brute force is king; might is the only right, and the strong
arm is the only argument whose logic meets with general recognition. In
warlike tribes fair equality is found, and the chief is only _primus
inter pares_; but when the nomadic tribe settles down into an
agricultural community, when the habit of bearing arms ceases to be
universal, when wealth begins to accumulate, and the village or town
offers attractions for pillage, then strength becomes at once a terror
and a possible defence. The weak obey some powerful neighbour partly
because they cannot resist, and partly because they desire, by their
submission, to gain a strong protection against their enemies. They
submit to the exactions of one that they may be shielded from the tyranny
of many, and yield up their natural liberty to some extent to preserve
themselves from being entirely enslaved. Very slowly do they learn that
the union of many individually feeble is stronger than a few powerful,
isolated tyrants, and gradually law takes the place of despotic will;
gradually the feeling of self-respect, of independence, of love of
liberty, grows, until at last man claims freedom as of right, and denies
the authority of any to rule him without his own consent.

Thus the Rights of Man have become an accepted doctrine, but,
unfortunately, they are only rights of _man,_ in the exclusive sense of
the word. They are sexual, and not human rights, and until they become
human rights, society will never rest on a sure, because just,
foundation. Women, as well as men, "are born and remain free and equal in
rights;" women, as well as men, have "natural and imprescriptible
rights;" for women, as well as for men, "these rights are--liberty,
property, safety, and resistance of tyranny." Of these rights only crime
should deprive them, just as by crime men also are deprived of them; to
deny these rights to women, is either to deny them to humanity _qua_
humanity, or to deny that women form a part of humanity; if women's
rights are denied, men's rights have no logical basis, no claim to
respect; then tyranny ceases to be a crime, slavery is no longer a
scandal; "either all human beings have equal rights, or none have any."

Naturally, in the savage state, women shared the fate of the physically
weak, not only because, as a rule, they are smaller-framed and less
muscular than their male comrades, but also because the bearing and
suckling of children is a drain on their physical resources from which men
are exempt. Hence she has suffered from "the right of the strongest,"
even more than has man, and her exclusion from all political life has
prevented the redressal which man has wrought out for himself; while
claiming freedom for himself he has not loosened her chains, and while
striking down his own tyrants, he has maintained his personal tyranny in
the home. Nor has this generally been done by deliberate intention: it is
rather the survival of the old system, which has only been abolished so
slowly as regards men. Mrs. Mill writes: "That those who were physically
weaker should have been made legally inferior, is quite conformable to
the mode in which the world has been governed. Until very lately, the
rule of physical strength was the general law of human affairs.
Throughout history, the nations, races, classes, which found themselves
strongest, either in muscles, in riches, or in military discipline, have
conquered and held in subjection the rest. If, even in the most improved
nations, the law of the sword is at last discountenanced as unworthy, it
is only since the calumniated eighteenth century. Wars of conquest have
only ceased since democratic revolutions began. The world is very young,
and has only just begun to cast off injustice. It is only now getting rid
of negro slavery. It is only now getting rid of monarchical despotism. It
is only now getting rid of hereditary feudal nobility. It is only now
getting rid of disabilities on the ground of religion. It is only
beginning to treat any _men_ as citizens, except the rich and a favoured
portion of the middle class. Can we wonder that it has not yet done as
much for women?" ("Enfranchisement of Women," Mrs. Mill. In J. S. Mill's
"Discussions and Dissertations," Vol. II., page 421.)

The difference between men and women in all civil rights is, however,
with few, although important, exceptions, confined to married women; i.e.,
women in relation with men. Unmarried women of all ages suffer under
comparatively few disabilities; it is marriage which brings with it the
weight of injustice and of legal degradation. In savage times marriage
was a matter either of force, fraud, or purchase. Women were merchandise,
by the sale of whom their male relatives profited, or they were captives
in war, the spoil of the conqueror, or they were stolen away from the
paternal home. In all cases, however, the possession once obtained, they
became the property of the men who married them, and the husband was
their "lord," their "master." In the old Hebrew books--still accounted
sacred by Jews and Christians--the wife is regarded as the property of
her husband. A man may "sell his daughter to be a maidservant" i.e., a
concubine, as is shown by the following verse (Ex. xxi. 7), and Jacob
served seven years for each of his wives, Leah and Rachel; his other two
wives were his by gift, and were rather concubines than recognised wives,
their children counting to their mistresses. If a Hebrew conquered his
enemies, the wives and daughters of the vanquished became his spoil, and
were treated as slaves (Deut. xx. 14; xxi. 10-14). A man might have as
many wives as he chose to take, and might "put them away" if they
"found no favour in his eyes" (Deut. xxiv. 1). The sole check on this
arbitrary power was the necessity of giving the dismissed wife "a bill of
divorcement;" this was necessary, not in the wife's interest, but in the
husband's, that he might not be chargeable for her maintenance, nor be
accountable if she married again. A wife had no corresponding power of
divorcing her husband. A husband might, by the Mosaic law, cause his wife
to be put to death if she had deceived him as to her virginity before
marriage (Deut. xxii. 13-21); if she committed adultery she was to be
stoned to death with her paramour (Deut. xxii. 22-24); if a husband were
jealous, he might submit his wife to the "trial of jealousy" (Num. v.
11-31); but no such power was given to the wife in case of the husband's
adultery or jealousy. The whole code is based on the idea that the wife
is the property of the husband, and that his rights over her are supreme.

Among the surrounding nations the marriage laws were very various. Among
some, relationship was counted only through the mother; among others
polyandry prevailed; among others, again, polygamy was the rule. In some
cases marriage was only temporary, the contract being terminable at the
will of either party. Among the Egyptians, indeed, the wife's position
was exceptionally high; Diodorus Siculus says that the queen was treated
with more respect than the king, and that among private persons the wife
ruled over her husband, the husband consenting in the marriage contract
to obey his wife in all things. Sir Gardiner Wilkinson confirms this
statement as to the wife's authority, and says that the husband was even
obliged to promise that he would remain faithful to his wife. The respect
paid to women by the Egyptians was remarkable in that age, and contrasts
favourably with the customs of the Hebrews and other surrounding nations.

In ancient Rome the wife was in a better position than among the Hebrews,
but she was still subject to her husband. In the early days of the
Republic, marriage was a religious contract, dissoluble only by the
consent of the Pontifex Maximus; later, it became a civil contract,
dissoluble at the will of either party. The Roman matron was a dignified
figure, respected and honoured in her home; but she had no political
rights, and her property passed under the control of her husband. Under
the Empire, the marriage tie became extremely lax, and divorce was
frequent and easy. Women acquired greater independence, both personal and
financial, but this was accompanied by a general decline in sexual
morality.

Christianity, while raising the spiritual status of women in some
respects, confirmed their legal and social subordination. The New
Testament writers taught that the husband was the head of the wife, and
that wives should submit themselves to their husbands in everything (Eph.
v. 22-24; Col. iii. 18; 1 Pet. iii. 1). Marriage was declared to be
indissoluble, except for adultery (Matt. v. 32; xix. 9), and even then
remarriage was often forbidden. The Church regarded marriage primarily as
a remedy against sin, and celibacy was exalted as a higher state.

Throughout the Middle Ages, the influence of the Church maintained the
indissolubility of marriage and the subordination of the wife. Marriage
law was largely under ecclesiastical control. While the Church sometimes
protected wives against the brutality of their husbands, it upheld the
doctrine of marital authority and female submission.

With the Reformation, marriage law passed more under the control of the
State, but the traditional view of marriage as indissoluble (or nearly
so) and the subordination of the wife persisted. Protestant reformers,
while rejecting celibacy, still emphasised the headship of the husband
and the duty of wifely obedience.

It is only in modern times, under the influence of rationalism,
individualism, and the woman movement, that the traditional conception of
marriage has been seriously challenged. The demand has arisen for
marriage based on love and equality, for the abolition of the husband's
legal authority, for the wife's right to control her own property and
person, and for greater freedom of divorce.

II.

MARRIAGE AS IT IS

In England, the marriage law, though modified in recent years, still
bears the impress of its ecclesiastical origin and its feudal history. It
is based on the assumption that husband and wife are "one person," and
that person is the husband.

Until the Married Women's Property Acts (1870, 1882), a wife's personal
property passed entirely into her husband's control upon marriage. Her
real property also came under his management, and he was entitled to its
income. She could not make contracts, sue or be sued, or make a will
without his consent. Marriage was, in effect, a legal annihilation of the
wife's separate existence.

The husband was legally responsible for his wife's debts (even those
contracted before marriage), and for certain wrongs committed by her. He
had the right to control her place of residence and her personal liberty.
He had the right to her domestic services without payment. He had the
right to sexual intercourse with her, and could enforce this right by
law (though this particular aspect has been modified by case law in
recent times).

The father was the sole legal guardian of the children born in wedlock.
He had the right to decide on their education, religion, and upbringing.
The mother had virtually no legal rights over her children during the
husband's lifetime.

Divorce was obtainable only through a private Act of Parliament until
1857. The Matrimonial Causes Act of that year established a special court
for divorce, but maintained a double standard: a husband could obtain a
divorce for his wife's adultery alone, while a wife had to prove not only
her husband's adultery but also cruelty, desertion, or some other
aggravating circumstance.

Subsequent legislation, particularly the Married Women's Property Acts,
the Guardianship of Infants Act (1925), and various reforms in divorce
law (notably the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937, which added cruelty,
desertion, and incurable insanity as grounds for divorce for either
party), have removed many of the grossest injustices of the old law.

Wives now retain control over their own property. Mothers have equal
rights with fathers regarding the guardianship and custody of children.
The grounds for divorce are now largely equalised between the sexes
(though adultery by the wife is still treated somewhat differently in
certain contexts).

However, the fundamental concept of marriage in English law remains
problematic. The assumption of the husband's headship, though weakened,
has not been entirely eradicated. The law still reflects, in many subtle
ways, the legacy of female subordination.

For example, the legal duty of the husband to maintain his wife (and the
corresponding lack of a general duty for the wife to maintain the
husband) implies an unequal economic relationship. The rules surrounding
domicile often treat the wife's domicile as dependent on her husband's.
The very language of the traditional marriage service, with its promise of
obedience from the wife, perpetuates an ideal of submission.

Furthermore, the divorce law, while reformed, still requires proof of
marital breakdown based on specific grounds (adultery, unreasonable
behaviour, desertion, separation with consent, separation without
consent). It does not yet fully embrace the principle of divorce based
simply on the irretrievable breakdown of the relationship, evidenced by
mutual consent or prolonged separation, without the need to assign fault.

In essence, marriage as it is in England today is a hybrid institution,
reflecting a transition from the old patriarchal model towards a more
egalitarian ideal, but still burdened by inconsistencies and remnants of
the past.

III.

MARRIAGE AS IT SHOULD BE

A rational and just marriage law should be based on the following
principles:

1.  **Equality:** Husband and wife should be absolutely equal in all legal
    rights and responsibilities. The concept of the husband's headship
    should be entirely abolished.

2.  **Freedom:** Marriage should be a free contract between two
    individuals, entered into voluntarily and dissoluble when the basis
    of mutual love and consent is irrevocably lost.

3.  **Partnership:** The law should regard marriage as a partnership, in
    which both partners contribute according to their abilities, whether
    financially or through domestic labour and childcare. Economic rights
    and responsibilities should reflect this partnership model.

4.  **Individuality:** Marriage should respect the individuality and
    personal autonomy of each partner. Neither partner should have the
    right to control the other's person, beliefs, or actions.

5.  **Responsibility towards Children:** The welfare of children should be
    paramount. Both parents should share equally in the rights and
    responsibilities of parenthood, both during marriage and after
    divorce.

Based on these principles, a reformed marriage law should include:

*   **Civil Marriage:** Marriage as a simple civil registration, devoid of
    religious requirements or implications.
*   **Equal Rights:** Complete equality in property rights, financial
    responsibilities, guardianship of children, personal liberty, and
    choice of domicile and name.
*   **Economic Partnership:** Recognition of domestic labour and childcare
    as valuable contributions to the marital partnership, to be taken
    into account in property division upon divorce.
*   **Free Divorce:** Divorce available by mutual consent after a short
    period of reflection, or at the request of one partner after a
    reasonable period of separation, without the need to prove marital
    fault. Procedures should be simple, private, and non-adversarial.
*   **Child Welfare:** Arrangements for child custody and support after
    divorce to be based solely on the child's best interests, with an
    emphasis on shared parental responsibility where possible.
*   **No Breach of Promise:** Abolition of the action for breach of promise
    to marry, which treats marriage as a commercial contract rather than
    a personal relationship.

Such a reformed marriage law would create a framework for relationships
based on love, equality, and mutual respect. It would remove the legal
subordination of women and allow marriage to become a true partnership
between free and equal individuals.

It would recognise that the only true marriage is one founded on love, and
that the law should not attempt to compel the continuation of a union
from which love has fled.

By establishing marriage on a basis of justice and freedom, we create the
conditions under which true and lasting love is most likely to flourish.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
