Foreword


As far as we know this is the first time anyone has written a book
attempting to put mate selection on a sensible basis, despite the fact
that sooner or later almost everybody selects one.

A good many people resent the idea of an outsider telling _them_ how they
should pick a mate. They think it smacks of meddling. Marriage is
something sacred and personal. It should not be done according to rules.

We heartily sympathize. Unfortunately, however, marriages are _not_ made
in Heaven. Usually people marry by hunch or impulse ... or because their
parents think it is a good match ... or because they get themselves so
deeply involved romantically that marrying seems the only proper thing to
do.

Too frequently such methods merely mess up a couple of people’s lives.
More than a third of all the millions of marriages undertaken in the last
ten years are in trouble. Many are already dissolved. Many more soon will
be.

A great deal of research and counseling has now been done in the field of
marriage, and the findings validated. At Penn State, for example,
hundreds of couples who were tested before marriage at the Marriage
Counseling Service are checked periodically after marriage to find how
they are making out. Of all the marriages which the service predicted
would be successful, not one has yet ended in divorce or separation. Most
of the people who went ahead despite the clinic’s cautions are already in
serious trouble or have been divorced.

As a result of many such investigations, reliable information is available
on the kinds of people who make the best mates, and on the causes of
marriage success and failure.

In this book we have tried to include those findings which should be most
helpful and interesting to all people involved in love or marriage--but
particularly to people who sooner or later will be taking unto themselves
a mate.

It is not our intention to lay down a set of rules for people to follow.
But we hope that after reading this book you will be more enlightened in
your hunches than you might be otherwise, and be a much happier and more
desirable mate yourself!




_How to Pick a Mate_




_Chapter I_

Why Marry, Anyhow?


Mating is as old as Eve. In fact it is the oldest and most popular custom
ever devised by mankind. Even in the most isolated tribes that explorers
have uncovered on this globe adult males pair up with females to live
together as man and wife.

In many areas of the world, it is true, marriages are still arranged by
the elders, often at a neat financial profit to the bride’s parents.
Freedom of choice in mating is a newfangled idea. And in Madagascar the
groom is warned at the wedding that he can beat the bride all he pleases,
but if he breaks any bones or gouges any eyes she has a perfect right to
go home to mother. Yet even there mating is popular.

Though marriage is the most universal institution known to man increasing
numbers of Americans are shunning it by divorce or otherwise. About ten
per cent of our marriageable men have become unbudgeable bachelors. The
number of women who are choosing careers to marriage is soaring.
Moreover there are 1,500,000 men and women in America who tried marriage
and are now living apart in divorce. Many others were divorced, then
remarried.

Thus “Why marry, anyhow?” is today a fair question.

So let’s face right at the start the main reasons why people do not marry,
or stay married.

Many people do not marry because they don’t relish the idea of giving up
their freedom, their independence. Some men do not like the idea of being
“saddled” with family responsibilities and being “tied down” to one
woman. Likewise, some women have become so accustomed to living alone--and
are so reluctant to give up careers--that they hesitate to give up their
independence, until it is too late.

Many other girls and men do not marry because they are too particular.
Often they have a “phantasy ideal” of the mate they want and can’t find
such an interesting person. Or they may be too shy to go out and meet
people. Or they may be afraid of marriage because their own parents were
unhappy.

Still others do not marry because they are too selfish or too immature to
share their lives with another person. They want everything their own way.
They are unwilling to make the compromises and adjustments that marriage
requires.

Finally, some people do not marry because they are physically or mentally
unfit. They may have hereditary defects, chronic illnesses, or serious
personality disorders that make them unsuitable for marriage.

These are some of the reasons why people do not marry. Now let’s look at
the reasons why they do.

**Why People Marry**

1.  **Love and Companionship:** This is the most common and most important
    reason. People marry because they fall in love and want to spend their
    lives with the person they love. They seek companionship, emotional
    security, and mutual support.

2.  **Desire for Children:** Most people want to have children and raise a
    family. Marriage provides the most stable and socially approved
    framework for having and rearing children.

3.  **Sexual Fulfillment:** Marriage provides a socially sanctioned and
    emotionally satisfying outlet for sexual expression.

4.  **Economic Security:** Historically, marriage was often an economic
    necessity, especially for women. While less true today, economic
    factors still play a role. Pooling resources can provide greater
    financial stability.

5.  **Social Pressure:** Society expects people to marry. There can be
    social pressure from family and friends, and sometimes a feeling of
    being “left out” if one remains single.

6.  **Escape:** Some people marry to escape an unhappy home situation, loneliness,
    or a sense of aimlessness.

7.  **Status:** Marriage can confer social status and a sense of belonging.

**Is Marriage Worth It?**

Despite the challenges and the rising divorce rate, the overwhelming
majority of people still choose to marry. Why? Because, for most people,
the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

A happy marriage offers:

*   **Deep Intimacy:** The opportunity for a unique depth of emotional and
    physical closeness with another person.
*   **Companionship:** A partner to share life’s joys and sorrows, successes
    and failures.
*   **Support:** Someone to rely on in times of need, to offer encouragement
    and understanding.
*   **Personal Growth:** Marriage challenges individuals to grow, to become
    less selfish, more patient, more understanding.
*   **Family Life:** The joys and challenges of raising children and creating
    a home.
*   **Health and Longevity:** Studies show that married people tend to live
    longer and be healthier than single people.

Marriage is not always easy. It requires effort, commitment, compromise,
and a willingness to work through difficulties. But for those who choose
their partners wisely and invest in their relationship, marriage can be
the most rewarding and fulfilling experience of life.

So, why marry? Because, despite its risks, marriage offers the best chance
for most people to find lasting love, companionship, and happiness.




_Chapter II_

Your Chances of Getting a Mate You’ll Like


Finding the right mate is not just a matter of luck. While chance plays a
part, your own attitudes, actions, and choices significantly influence
your prospects.

**Factors Affecting Your Chances:**

1.  **Your Desirability:** How attractive are you as a potential mate? This
    involves not just physical appearance, but also personality,
    character, intelligence, social skills, emotional maturity, and health.
    The more desirable qualities you possess, the wider your choice of
    partners.

2.  **Your Standards:** What are you looking for in a mate? Realistic
    standards increase your chances. Unrealistic or overly rigid
    expectations (“fantasy ideal”) can lead to disappointment or prevent
    you from recognizing a suitable partner.

3.  **Your Opportunities:** How many eligible potential partners do you meet?
    This depends on factors like:
    *   **Where you live:** Urban areas generally offer more opportunities
        than rural areas.
    *   **Your social activities:** Participating in groups, hobbies, sports,
        or community activities increases your chances of meeting people
        with similar interests.
    *   **Your work or school environment:** These are common places to meet
        potential partners.
    *   **Your willingness to circulate:** Being open to meeting new people
        through friends, family, or even dating services.

4.  **Your Age:** The prime marrying age is generally considered the twenties.
    While marriage is possible at any age, the pool of available partners
    tends to shrink, and adjustment can become more difficult, as one gets
    older.

5.  **The Sex Ratio:** The number of available men versus women in your age
    group and geographical area can affect your chances. Wars, migration
    patterns, and other factors can create imbalances.

6.  **Your Attitude:** A positive, open, and friendly attitude makes you more
    approachable and attractive. Shyness, cynicism, or excessive eagerness
    can be detrimental.

**Improving Your Chances:**

You can actively improve your chances of finding a suitable mate:

*   **Self-Improvement:** Work on becoming the best version of yourself.
    Develop your personality, cultivate interests, take care of your health
    and appearance. Address any significant personal problems (e.g.,
    excessive shyness, bad temper).
*   **Expand Your Social Circle:** Make an effort to meet new people.
    Join clubs, take classes, volunteer, accept invitations. Let friends
    and family know you are open to introductions.
*   **Be Realistic:** Examine your expectations. Are they achievable? Are
    you overlooking potentially good partners because they don’t fit a
    preconceived image?
*   **Be Approachable:** Smile, be friendly, show interest in others. Don’t
    be afraid to initiate conversations.
*   **Develop Social Skills:** Learn how to converse easily, be a good
    listener, and make others feel comfortable.
*   **Don’t Be Desperate:** While being open to marriage is good, appearing
    overly anxious or desperate can drive potential partners away.

**Test: What Is Your Expectancy of Marriage?**

This test, developed by Dr. Adams, helps gauge your likelihood of marrying
within the next five years, based on factors known to correlate with
marriage probability. Answer honestly.

(Note: The actual test questions and scoring are omitted in this text
version but would involve assessing factors like age, social activities,
dating frequency, attitudes towards marriage, personality traits, etc.)

**Conclusion:**

Finding a mate you’ll like involves a combination of self-awareness,
realistic expectations, social effort, and perhaps a little luck. By
understanding the factors involved and taking proactive steps, you can
significantly increase your chances of achieving a happy marriage.




_Chapter III_

Are You Ready for Married Love?


Marriage requires more than just being “in love.” It demands a certain
level of maturity--chronological, emotional, and social. Are you truly
ready for the commitments and responsibilities of married life?

**Chronological Age:**

As discussed earlier, marrying too young (teens or early twenties)
carries significant risks due to immaturity and unformed personalities.
While there’s no magic number, most experts agree that the mid-twenties
or later is generally preferable. By this time, individuals usually have a
better sense of self, more life experience, and greater financial
stability.

**Test: Are You Old Enough to Marry?**

(Note: Test details omitted. Would likely assess age, education level,
career establishment, financial independence, etc.)

**Emotional Maturity:**

This is even more crucial than chronological age. Emotional maturity means:

*   **Independence:** You are not overly dependent on your parents or others
    for emotional support or decision-making.
*   **Self-Awareness:** You understand your own feelings, strengths, and
    weaknesses.
*   **Emotional Control:** You can manage your emotions (anger, jealousy,
    disappointment) constructively, without excessive outbursts or
    withdrawal.
*   **Responsibility:** You accept responsibility for your actions and
    choices.
*   **Empathy:** You can understand and respect your partner’s feelings and
    perspective, even when you disagree.
*   **Flexibility:** You can adapt to change and compromise when necessary.
*   **Giving and Receiving Love:** You can express affection freely and
    accept love from others.
*   **Realistic Outlook:** You have a balanced view of life and
    relationships, avoiding excessive idealism or cynicism.

**Test: Are You Grown Up Emotionally?**

(Note: Test details omitted. Would likely assess traits like
dependability, self-control, empathy, responsibility, adaptability, etc.,
through situational questions or self-ratings.)

**Social Maturity:**

This involves your ability to interact effectively with others and navigate
social situations:

*   **Social Skills:** You can converse easily, make friends, and handle
    various social settings.
*   **Consideration:** You are thoughtful of others’ needs and feelings.
*   **Cooperation:** You can work and live cooperatively with others.
*   **Handling Relationships:** You can manage relationships with friends,
    family, and in-laws appropriately.

**Other Factors Indicating Readiness:**

*   **Completion of Education/Career Establishment:** Having a stable
    foundation for financial support.
*   **Resolution of Major Personal Issues:** Addressing significant problems
    like addiction, severe debt, or unresolved psychological issues _before_
    marriage.
*   **Realistic Understanding of Marriage:** Recognizing that marriage
    involves challenges and requires effort, not just romance.
*   **Ability to Make Decisions:** Capable of making important life decisions
    independently and thoughtfully.

**Conclusion:**

Readiness for marriage is a combination of age, emotional maturity, social
skills, and practical preparedness. Rushing into marriage before you are
truly ready significantly increases the risk of failure. Honest
self-assessment, perhaps aided by tests like those mentioned or
discussion with a trusted counselor, can help determine if you are
prepared for the lifelong commitment of married love.




_Chapter IV_

Is It Love--or Infatuation?


Many unhappy marriages result from mistaking infatuation for genuine love.
Infatuation is intense but often superficial and short-lived. Love is
deeper, more enduring, and based on a fuller knowledge and acceptance of
the partner.

How can you tell the difference?

**Characteristics of Infatuation:**

1.  **Sudden Onset:** Often begins very quickly, “love at first sight.”
2.  **Focus on Physical Appearance:** Primarily based on strong physical
    attraction and sexual chemistry.
3.  **Idealization:** You see the partner as perfect, overlooking or
    minimizing flaws. You are “blinded” by emotion.
4.  **Intensity and Urgency:** Feelings are overwhelming, consuming. There’s
    a sense of urgency to be together constantly and perhaps rush into
    commitment.
5.  **Emotional Rollercoaster:** Marked by extreme highs (ecstasy when
    together) and lows (despair when separated or facing obstacles).
6.  **Jealousy and Possessiveness:** Often accompanied by insecurity, fear
    of loss, and intense jealousy.
7.  **Limited Knowledge:** Based on relatively little real knowledge of the
    partner’s character, values, and background.
8.  **Neglect of Other Relationships/Responsibilities:** Tendency to neglect
    friends, family, work, or studies due to obsession with the partner.
9.  **Disapproval from Others:** Friends or family may express concerns or
    disapprove, seeing issues that the infatuated person ignores.
10. **Fades with Time/Obstacles:** Often cools down quickly once the initial
    excitement wears off or when faced with real-life challenges.

**Characteristics of Love:**

1.  **Gradual Development:** Usually grows over time as you get to know the
    person deeply.
2.  **Focus on the Whole Person:** Based on appreciation for the partner’s
    total personality--character, intelligence, values, sense of humor--not
    just physical appearance.
3.  **Realistic View:** You recognize and accept the partner’s flaws and
    imperfections, loving them “warts and all.”
4.  **Calm and Security:** Feelings are deep and steady, bringing a sense of
    peace, security, and companionship.
5.  **Trust and Confidence:** Based on mutual trust, respect, and confidence
    in the partner and the relationship.
6.  **Desire for Partner’s Well-being:** Genuine concern for the partner’s
    happiness and growth, willingness to put their needs first at times.
7.  **Deep Knowledge and Understanding:** Based on thorough knowledge of the
    partner’s background, values, beliefs, hopes, and fears.
8.  **Enhances Other Relationships/Responsibilities:** Motivates you to be a
    better person; complements rather than conflicts with other important
    aspects of your life.
9.  **Approval from Others:** Generally supported and approved by friends
    and family who know you both well.
10. **Endures and Deepens:** Grows stronger and deeper over time, weathering
    challenges and difficulties.

**Test: Are You Really in Love?**

(Note: Test details omitted. Would likely present scenarios or statements
reflecting characteristics of love vs. infatuation and ask the user to rate
their applicability to their relationship.)

**The Importance of Time:**

One of the surest ways to distinguish love from infatuation is time.
Infatuation often burns out quickly, while love endures and grows.
Allowing a relationship to develop over a reasonable period (at least six
months to a year or more) before making a lifelong commitment provides
the opportunity to see if the initial attraction deepens into lasting love.

Basing marriage on infatuation is risky. Building it on genuine love,
characterized by knowledge, respect, trust, and commitment, provides a much
stronger foundation for lasting happiness.




_Chapter V_

Growing Up Sexually


Sexual adjustment is a crucial part of marriage, yet many people enter
marriage with inadequate knowledge, unhealthy attitudes, or unrealistic
expectations about sex.

**The Importance of Healthy Sexual Development:**

A person’s attitude towards sex is shaped throughout childhood and
adolescence by family, peers, religion, culture, and personal experiences.
Healthy sexual development involves:

*   **Accurate Information:** Understanding the biological facts of sex and
    reproduction.
*   **Positive Attitudes:** Viewing sex as a natural, healthy, and positive
    part of life and loving relationships, free from excessive guilt, shame,
    or fear.
*   **Self-Understanding:** Awareness of one’s own sexual feelings and
    responses.
*   **Respect for Others:** Understanding the importance of consent, mutual
    respect, and responsibility in sexual expression.
*   **Integration with Personality:** Seeing sexuality as an integral part of
    one’s whole personality and relationships, not just a physical act.

**Common Problems in Sexual Development:**

*   **Ignorance:** Lack of basic knowledge about sexual anatomy, physiology,
    or response.
*   **Negative Conditioning:** Growing up with messages that sex is dirty,
    sinful, or shameful.
*   **Fear and Anxiety:** Fears about performance, pregnancy, disease, or
    pain.
*   **Guilt:** Lingering guilt from past experiences or strict upbringing.
*   **Unrealistic Expectations:** Beliefs derived from pornography or media
    that don’t reflect real-life intimacy.
*   **Past Trauma:** Experiences of sexual abuse or assault.

**Achieving Sexual Maturity:**

Sexual maturity is not just about physical development; it’s about
integrating sexuality into a mature personality and capacity for intimate
relationship. It involves:

*   **Acceptance:** Accepting one’s own sexuality and that of one’s partner.
*   **Communication:** Ability to talk openly and honestly with a partner
    about sexual needs, desires, and concerns.
*   **Responsibility:** Understanding the potential consequences of sexual
    activity (emotional, physical, relational) and acting responsibly.
*   **Capacity for Intimacy:** Ability to combine physical expression with
    emotional closeness, love, and commitment.
*   **Consideration:** Sensitivity to the partner’s needs and feelings.

**Preparing for Marital Sex:**

*   **Education:** Seek accurate information from reliable sources (books,
    doctors, counselors).
*   **Open Discussion:** Talk with your fiancé(e) about your attitudes,
    expectations, hopes, and fears regarding sex in marriage.
*   **Medical Check-up:** Both partners should have a premarital physical
    examination, including discussion of contraception if desired.
*   **Address Issues:** If you have significant anxieties, guilt, or negative
    attitudes about sex, consider seeking counseling before marriage.

Sexual adjustment in marriage takes time, patience, communication, and
mutual understanding. Entering marriage with healthy attitudes and adequate
knowledge provides the best foundation for achieving a fulfilling and
mutually satisfying sexual relationship.




_Chapter VI_

Sex Adventuring


This chapter addresses premarital and extramarital sexual activity.
Attitudes towards non-marital sex vary widely, but from the perspective of
building a successful marriage, such activities often carry significant
risks.

**Premarital Sex:**

Arguments often made _for_ premarital sex include:

*   Testing sexual compatibility before marriage.
*   Expressing love and intimacy.
*   Gaining sexual experience.
*   Natural expression of strong feelings.

Arguments _against_ premarital sex, particularly in the context of marital
preparation, include:

1.  **Risk of Pregnancy:** Unwanted pregnancy can force a premature or
    unsuitable marriage, or lead to difficult decisions about abortion or
    adoption.
2.  **Risk of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs):** Can have serious
    long-term health consequences and affect future fertility.
3.  **Emotional Consequences:** Can lead to guilt, anxiety, regret, damage to
    reputation, and emotional pain if the relationship ends.
4.  **Impact on Relationship:** May focus the relationship too heavily on sex,
    obscuring other aspects of compatibility. Can create insecurity and
    jealousy. May cheapen the meaning of sex within marriage.
5.  **Comparison:** Past sexual experiences can sometimes lead to unfavorable
    comparisons with the marital partner.
6.  **Moral/Religious Objections:** Many ethical and religious traditions
    teach that sexual intercourse should be reserved for marriage.

While some couples engage in premarital sex without apparent negative
consequences, studies often show a correlation between premarital
intercourse (especially with multiple partners) and lower marital
stability and satisfaction later on.

**Extramarital Sex (Adultery):**

Having sexual relations with someone other than one’s spouse is almost
universally damaging to a marriage. It involves:

1.  **Betrayal of Trust:** Adultery violates the fundamental promise of
    fidelity and shatters the trust that is essential for marital intimacy
    and security.
2.  **Emotional Devastation:** Discovery of an affair typically causes
    intense pain, anger, and disillusionment for the betrayed spouse.
3.  **Damage to Self-Esteem:** Both the betrayed spouse and sometimes the
    unfaithful partner can suffer damage to their self-worth.
4.  **Risk of STDs and Pregnancy:** Introduces health risks and potential
    complications.
5.  **Potential for Divorce:** Adultery is a leading cause of divorce.
    Rebuilding trust after an affair is extremely difficult, though not
    always impossible.

Even if the affair is kept secret, it often creates emotional distance,
guilt, and deception within the marriage, eroding the quality of the
relationship.

**Test: Are You Warm or Cool by Nature?**

(Note: Test details omitted. Would likely assess general level of sexual
interest, responsiveness, and comfort with intimacy, relevant to
understanding potential compatibility but not justifying non-marital sex.)

**Conclusion:**

From the standpoint of achieving a stable and happy marriage, “sex
adventuring” outside of the marital relationship carries substantial risks.
Premarital sex can complicate the process of mate selection and create
emotional and physical hazards. Extramarital sex is profoundly destructive
to the trust and commitment upon which marriage depends.

A fulfilling sexual relationship built on love, commitment, and fidelity
within marriage offers the greatest potential for lasting satisfaction and
intimacy.




_Chapter VII_

Do You Frighten Possible Mates Away?


Sometimes individuals who desire marriage unconsciously sabotage their own
chances by exhibiting personality traits or behaviours that repel potential
partners.

**Common Repellent Traits and Behaviours:**

1.  **Negativity and Cynicism:** Constant complaining, pessimism, fault-finding,
    or a generally sour outlook on life.
2.  **Self-Centeredness:** Excessive focus on oneself, lack of interest in
    others, dominating conversations with “I, me, my.”
3.  **Aggressiveness and Argumentativeness:** Being overly opinionated,
    contradicting others constantly, needing to “win” every discussion.
4.  **Desperation and Clinginess:** Appearing overly anxious to marry,
    becoming possessive or demanding too early in a relationship.
5.  **Insecurity and Lack of Confidence:** Constant need for reassurance,
    self-deprecation, inability to make decisions.
6.  **Poor Social Skills:** Shyness to the point of withdrawal, awkwardness
    in conversation, lack of basic manners.
7.  **Dishonesty:** Lying, exaggeration, lack of sincerity.
8.  **Emotional Immaturity:** Temper tantrums, pouting, inability to handle
    disappointment, excessive dependence.
9.  **Poor Grooming and Hygiene:** Neglecting personal appearance.
10. **Gold-Digging or Status-Seeking:** Obvious focus on a potential
    partner’s money or social position rather than the person.
11. **Flirtatiousness (Excessive):** Flirting indiscriminately can signal
    lack of seriousness or trustworthiness.
12. **Gossip and Malice:** Speaking ill of others.
13. **Trying Too Hard:** Being overly eager to please, insincere flattery,
    lack of authenticity.
14. **Rigidity and Unwillingness to Compromise:** Insisting on having one’s
    own way in everything.

**Self-Assessment:**

It requires honesty and self-awareness to recognize these traits in
oneself. Consider:

*   How do people generally react to you?
*   Do you have difficulty making or keeping friends?
*   Have past relationships ended for similar reasons?
*   Ask a trusted friend for honest feedback (if you can handle it!).

**Test: Do You Have a Negative or Positive Personality?**

(Note: Test details omitted. Would likely assess traits like optimism vs.
pessimism, friendliness vs. hostility, self-confidence vs. insecurity,
interest in others vs. self-absorption.)

**Making Changes:**

If you recognize repellent traits in yourself, it is possible to change.
This may involve:

*   **Conscious Effort:** Making a deliberate effort to practice more
    positive behaviours (e.g., listening more, complaining less, showing
    interest in others).
*   **Developing Social Skills:** Taking courses or reading books on
    communication and social interaction.
*   **Building Self-Confidence:** Focusing on your strengths, pursuing
    interests, achieving small successes.
*   **Seeking Professional Help:** Counseling can help identify the roots of
    negative patterns and develop strategies for change.

Becoming a more positive, considerate, and emotionally mature person not
only increases your chances of attracting a suitable mate but also makes
you a happier and more successful individual in all areas of life.




_Chapter VIII_

Attracting the One You Want


Once you have identified the type of person you would like to marry, how
do you attract their interest? While manipulation is counterproductive,
there are positive ways to present yourself and increase your appeal.

**Key Elements of Attraction:**

1.  **Appearance:** While not the most important factor in the long run,
    good grooming, appropriate dress, and taking care of your physical
    health make a positive first impression.
2.  **Personality:** Positive traits like warmth, friendliness, kindness,
    sense of humor, enthusiasm, and confidence are universally attractive.
3.  **Social Skills:** Ability to converse easily, listen attentively, show
    interest in others, and navigate social situations gracefully.
4.  **Shared Interests:** Having common hobbies, activities, or intellectual
    pursuits provides a basis for connection.
5.  **Character:** Underlying qualities like honesty, integrity,
    dependability, and kindness become increasingly important as a
    relationship develops.
6.  **Self-Confidence:** Believing in your own worth makes you more
    attractive to others. (This is different from arrogance.)
7.  **Being Yourself:** Authenticity is appealing. Trying to be someone
    you’re not usually backfires.

**Strategies for Attracting a Specific Person:**

*   **Be Visible:** Place yourself in situations where you are likely to
    encounter the person (e.g., join the same clubs, attend the same
    events), but avoid obvious stalking.
*   **Be Friendly and Approachable:** Smile, make eye contact, be open to
    conversation.
*   **Show Genuine Interest:** Ask questions about their interests, opinions,
    and experiences. Be a good listener.
*   **Find Common Ground:** Discover shared interests and use them as a basis
    for conversation and potential shared activities.
*   **Highlight Your Positive Qualities:** Without bragging, let your
    strengths and positive personality traits show.
*   **Be Considerate and Kind:** Small acts of thoughtfulness can make a big
    impression.
*   **Maintain Your Own Life:** Don’t make the person the sole focus of your
    existence. Continue pursuing your own interests and friendships. Having
    a full life makes you more interesting.
*   **Respect Their Space:** Don’t be overly pushy or demanding of their
    time and attention, especially early on.
*   **Patience:** Building attraction and interest takes time.

**Check List: What Traits to Look for in Mates**

(Note: List details omitted. Would likely include key desirable traits
related to character, personality, compatibility, maturity, etc., serving
as a reminder of what constitutes a good potential partner.)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Reciprocity:** Attraction should ideally be mutual. While you can take
    steps to increase your appeal, you cannot force someone to be
    interested in you.
*   **Compatibility:** Attraction alone is not enough. Ensure the person you
    are attracted to is also someone you are fundamentally compatible with
    for a long-term relationship.

Attracting the one you want involves presenting the best version of your
authentic self, showing genuine interest, and creating opportunities for
connection, while respecting the other person’s feelings and autonomy.




_Chapter IX_

Is the One You Want the One You Need?


Attraction can be misleading. The person you are initially drawn to (the
one you _want_) may not possess the qualities necessary for a stable and
happy marriage (the one you _need_).

**Why We Want the “Wrong” People:**

*   **Superficial Attraction:** We may be drawn by physical appearance,
    charm, status, or excitement, overlooking deeper incompatibilities or
    character flaws.
*   **Unconscious Needs:** We may unconsciously seek partners who replicate
    unhealthy patterns from our childhood (e.g., seeking a critical
    partner like a critical parent, or a dependent partner if we need to
    feel needed).
*   **Opposites Attract (Initially):** While differences can add spice, too
    many fundamental differences in values, personality, or life goals can
    lead to conflict later.
*   **Rebellion:** Choosing a partner disapproved of by family or society as
    a form of rebellion.
*   **Low Self-Esteem:** Believing we don’t deserve a truly good partner, so
    we settle for someone unsuitable.
*   **Infatuation:** Mistaking intense but fleeting infatuation for lasting
    love (as discussed in Chapter IV).

**Distinguishing Want vs. Need:**

To determine if the person you want is also the person you need for a
happy marriage, ask yourself:

1.  **Beyond the Initial Attraction:** What qualities do I admire in this
    person besides their looks or charm? Do they have strong character,
    integrity, kindness?
2.  **Compatibility:** Do we share fundamental values regarding family,
    money, religion, ethics, life goals? Are our personalities reasonably
    compatible for day-to-day living?
3.  **Communication:** Can we talk openly and honestly, even about difficult
    subjects? Can we resolve disagreements constructively?
4.  **Respect:** Do we have mutual respect for each other as individuals?
    Do they support my growth and well-being?
5.  **Trust:** Is there a foundation of trust and dependability?
6.  **How Do They Treat Others?** Observe how they treat family members,
    friends, service people. This often reveals their true character.
7.  **How Do They Handle Stress/Adversity?** Do they become overly angry,
    withdrawn, or blaming? Or do they face challenges constructively?
8.  **Do They Bring Out the Best in Me?** Do I feel like a better person
    when I am with them? Does the relationship enhance my life overall?
9.  **Long-Term Vision:** Can I realistically picture spending my life with
    this person, sharing responsibilities, raising a family (if desired),
    and growing old together?
10. **Input from Others:** What do trusted friends and family members, who
    know both of us well, think about the relationship? While not decisive,
    their perspectives can be valuable.

**Conclusion:**

Emotional attraction (want) is necessary for marriage, but it must be
balanced with rational assessment (need). Look beyond the initial spark to
evaluate the deeper qualities of character, compatibility, and shared
values that are essential for building a lasting and fulfilling partnership.
Choosing a mate based on need as well as want significantly increases the
chances of marital success.




_Chapter X_

Crucial Traits for a Happy Marriage


Research into successful and unsuccessful marriages has identified certain
personality traits and background factors that are strongly correlated with
marital happiness. While no single trait guarantees success, possessing a
good number of these positive characteristics significantly improves the
odds.

**Key Traits and Factors:**

1.  **Emotional Maturity:** (As discussed in Chapter III) Includes stability,
    dependability, self-control, responsibility, empathy, flexibility.
2.  **Good Character:** Honesty, integrity, kindness, consideration for
    others, loyalty.
3.  **Positive Attitude:** Optimism, cheerfulness, sense of humor, ability
    to enjoy life.
4.  **Compatibility:** Shared values, similar interests, compatible
    temperaments, agreement on major life goals (children, lifestyle,
    religion, etc.).
5.  **Good Communication Skills:** Ability to express oneself clearly and
    listen effectively, willingness to discuss problems constructively.
6.  **Affectionate Nature:** Ability to give and receive love and affection
    freely.
7.  **Healthy Family Background:** Coming from a home where parents had a
    reasonably happy marriage provides a positive model. Good relationship
    with one’s own parents is also a positive sign.
8.  **Good Mental and Physical Health:** Absence of serious, untreated
    mental health issues (like severe neurosis or personality disorders)
    or chronic physical health problems that could severely strain the
    marriage (though couples can certainly cope with health challenges
    together).
9.  **Social Adaptability:** Ability to get along well with others, make
    friends, handle social situations.
10. **Responsible Attitude Towards Sex:** Viewing sex as part of a loving,
    committed relationship; absence of major sexual inhibitions or
    deviations.
11. **Similar Backgrounds (Generally Helpful):** While not essential,
    similarity in socio-economic status, education level, religious
    background, and ethnicity can reduce potential areas of friction.
    (See Chapter XIII on Mixed Marriages).
12. **Realistic Expectations:** Understanding that marriage requires effort,
    compromise, and involves ups and downs.

**Ten Basic Background Questions:**

(Note: Questions omitted. Would likely probe areas like happiness of
parents’ marriage, relationship with parents, childhood happiness,
history of delinquency, social group affiliation, religious activity,
educational level, etc., which research has linked to marital outcomes.)

**Importance of Self-Assessment:**

It’s crucial to evaluate not only a potential partner but also oneself
against these traits. Do _you_ possess the qualities needed to be a good
spouse? Marriage is a two-way street, and your own maturity, character,
and attitudes are just as important as your partner’s.

**Conclusion:**

While love is the spark, these crucial traits provide the fuel for a
lasting and happy marriage. Look for a partner who possesses a good measure
of emotional maturity, good character, compatibility, and a positive
attitude. Cultivate these qualities in yourself. Choosing a partner based
on these fundamental characteristics, rather than just superficial
attraction, lays the groundwork for enduring marital success.




_Chapter XI_

Test Your Mate and Yourself


This chapter presents a series of short tests designed to measure some of
the key personality traits discussed in the previous chapter, which are
important for marital happiness. These tests are based on research and
have been validated through follow-up studies of married couples.

**Instructions:**

Rate both yourself and your potential mate (or spouse) on each trait.
Be as honest and objective as possible. If rating a potential mate you
don’t know extremely well, base your answers on your observations and
interactions.

(Note: The specific questions and detailed scoring for each test are
omitted in this text version. The descriptions below indicate the trait
being measured.)

**The Tests:**

1.  **Test 9: Sociability:** Measures degree of extroversion vs.
    introversion, enjoyment of social activities, ease in making friends.
    (Moderate sociability is generally best; extremes can cause conflict if
    partners differ greatly.)

2.  **Test 10: Conformity:** Measures tendency to adhere to social norms,
    conventionality, respect for rules and authority. (High conformity is
    generally associated with greater marital stability.)

3.  **Test 11: Tranquillity:** Measures calmness vs. excitability, freedom
    from worry and anxiety, general emotional stability. (Higher
    tranquillity is desirable.)

4.  **Test 12: Dependability:** Measures reliability, responsibility,
    conscientiousness, trustworthiness. (High dependability is crucial.)

5.  **Test 13: Stability:** Measures consistency of mood and behaviour,
    freedom from excessive ups and downs, resilience under stress.
    (Higher stability is very important.)

6.  **Test 14: Standards and Ideals:** Measures ethical standards, ambition,
    desire for self-improvement, seriousness of purpose. (High standards
    are generally positive.)

7.  **Test 15: Steadiness:** Measures persistence, perseverance in work and
    goals, resistance to distraction. (Higher steadiness is favorable.)

8.  **Test 16: Flexibility:** Measures adaptability, willingness to
    compromise, open-mindedness, ability to adjust to change. (High
    flexibility is very beneficial in marriage.)

9.  **Test 17: Seriousness:** Measures thoughtfulness vs. frivolity,
    interest in serious matters, sense of responsibility. (Moderate to
    high seriousness is generally better than extreme frivolity.)

10. **Test 18: Family Background:** Assesses factors like happiness of
    parents’ marriage, closeness to parents and siblings, overall childhood
    happiness. (A positive background is advantageous.)

**Composite Score: Prediction of Individual Marital Happiness (Test 19)**

By combining the scores from the individual trait tests and background
assessment, a composite score can be calculated that provides a general
prediction of an individual’s likelihood of achieving happiness in
marriage. Research shows these predictions are statistically significant,
though not infallible for any specific individual.

**Using the Results:**

These tests are tools for self-understanding and evaluating potential
partners. Low scores on crucial traits like dependability, stability, or
flexibility should be seen as warning signs requiring careful consideration.
Discussing the results (perhaps not the specific scores, but the traits
themselves) can be a valuable way to deepen understanding in a
relationship.

Remember, these tests measure tendencies. People can change, and strong
love and commitment can overcome some difficulties. However, entering
marriage with eyes open to potential challenges based on personality traits
is far wiser than ignoring them.




_Chapter XII_

Now, See How You Match As a Couple!


Individual happiness in marriage depends not only on each partner’s
personality but also on how well their personalities _match_. Compatibility
is key. This chapter explores how to assess the match between you and your
potential mate.

**Areas of Compatibility to Consider:**

1.  **Values and Life Goals:** Do you agree on fundamental issues like the
    importance of religion, having children, financial priorities,
    political views, ethical standards? Major disagreements here are hard
    to reconcile.

2.  **Interests and Activities:** Do you enjoy doing things together? While
    it’s healthy to have separate interests, sharing some leisure
    activities strengthens the bond.

3.  **Temperament:** Are your basic personalities compatible? Examples:
    *   **Sociability:** Can an extreme extrovert be happy with an extreme
        introvert? Requires compromise.
    *   **Energy Levels:** A very active person with a very sedentary one?
    *   **Moods:** Two highly volatile people may clash constantly. Two very
        somber people may lack joy.
    *   **Dominance/Submission:** Two highly dominant personalities may
        struggle for control. Two very submissive ones may have trouble
        making decisions.
    Generally, similarity in temperament is easier, but complementary
    differences can work if respected.

4.  **Communication Styles:** Do you understand each other? Can you resolve
    disagreements effectively?

5.  **Intelligence and Education:** While exact equality isn’t necessary,
    large disparities can sometimes lead to difficulties in communication or
    shared interests.

6.  **Backgrounds:** As mentioned before, similarity in socio-economic,
    religious, and cultural backgrounds generally makes adjustment easier,
    though differences can certainly be overcome with effort and
    understanding.

7.  **Role Expectations:** Do you agree on the roles of husband and wife,
    especially regarding careers, housework, and childcare?

**Test 20: Do You Match?**

This test compares the scores of both partners on the personality traits
measured in Chapter XI (Sociability, Conformity, Tranquillity, etc.).
Research indicates:

*   **Similarity is generally best** for most traits related to values,
    standards, and stability (e.g., Conformity, Dependability, Standards,
    Steadiness, Seriousness).
*   **Moderate differences** in traits like Sociability or Flexibility can
    be manageable or even complementary.
*   **Large differences** on almost any trait increase the potential for
    conflict and require greater adjustment.

(Note: Specific scoring method for the match omitted.)

**Test 21: Are You Well Mated? (Overall Compatibility Score)**

This combines the assessment of background similarity, value agreement,
interest compatibility, and personality match (from Test 20) into an
overall prediction of marital compatibility.

(Note: Specific scoring method omitted.)

**Interpreting Compatibility Scores:**

High compatibility scores suggest a smoother path and greater likelihood of
success. Low scores indicate potential friction points that will require
significant effort, compromise, and communication to manage successfully.
A very low compatibility score is a serious warning sign that the marriage
may be unwise.

**Beyond Tests:**

Compatibility is more than just test scores. It’s about the overall
feeling of ease, understanding, and connection you have with the partner.
Do you feel comfortable being yourself? Do you genuinely enjoy each other’s
company? Do you function well as a team?

Assessing compatibility requires both objective analysis (like considering
test results and background factors) and subjective feeling. Both are
important in making the decision about a lifelong partner.




_Chapter XIII_

Beware of Mixed Marriages


A “mixed marriage” typically refers to a union between partners from
significantly different backgrounds, most commonly involving differences
in religion, race, or nationality/culture. While love can certainly
transcend these differences, mixed marriages often face unique challenges
that require extra understanding, tolerance, and commitment.

**Types of Mixed Marriages and Potential Challenges:**

1.  **Interfaith Marriages:** (e.g., Catholic-Protestant, Jewish-Christian)
    *   **Religious Practices:** Disagreements over attending services,
        observing holidays, dietary laws.
    *   **Raising Children:** Major conflicts can arise over the religious
        upbringing of children (baptism, confirmation, religious education).
    *   **Family Pressure:** Disapproval or interference from families on
        either side.
    *   **Differing Values:** Sometimes religious differences reflect deeper
        differences in core values or worldview.
    *   **Success Factors:** Requires deep mutual respect for each other’s
        beliefs, open communication, and clear agreement _before_ marriage
        on how religious differences (especially regarding children) will be
        handled.

2.  **Interracial Marriages:**
    *   **Social Prejudice:** Couples may face discrimination, hostility, or
        lack of acceptance from society, community, and sometimes even
        family.
    *   **Cultural Differences:** Varying customs, traditions, communication
        styles, or family expectations.
    *   **Raising Children:** Children may face identity issues or prejudice.
    *   **Success Factors:** Requires strong individual character, deep
        commitment, resilience against external pressures, supportive social
        networks, and celebration of both cultural backgrounds.

3.  **International/Intercultural Marriages:**
    *   **Cultural Misunderstandings:** Differences in customs, values,
        social etiquette, gender roles, family obligations.
    *   **Language Barriers:** Can impede communication, especially early on
        or during conflict.
    *   **Distance from Family:** One partner is usually far from their
        family support system.
    *   **Legal/Immigration Issues:** Navigating visas, residency, citizenship.
    *   **Success Factors:** Requires high degree of adaptability,
        open-mindedness, patience, willingness to learn about the partner’s
        culture, and strong communication skills.

4.  **Significant Age Difference Marriages:** (e.g., 15+ years difference)
    *   **Differing Energy Levels/Interests:** May have different social
        preferences or physical capabilities.
    *   **Generational Gap:** Differences in perspectives, cultural
        references, life experiences.
    *   **Health Issues:** Greater likelihood of the older partner facing
        health problems sooner.
    *   **Social Disapproval:** May face judgment or assumptions from others.
    *   **Power Imbalance:** Potential for the older partner to be overly
        controlling or the younger one overly dependent.
    *   **Success Factors:** Requires shared core values, mutual respect,
        addressing potential issues openly, and focusing on the strengths of
        the connection.

5.  **Significant Socio-Economic/Educational Difference Marriages:**
    *   **Differing Lifestyles/Expectations:** Clashes over spending habits,
        social activities, aspirations.
    *   **Communication Barriers:** Differences in vocabulary, interests, ways
        of thinking.
    *   **Family Disapproval:** Families may feel the partner is “not good
        enough” or “marrying beneath them.”
    *   **Success Factors:** Requires mutual respect, valuing the partner for
        who they are regardless of background, shared core values, and
        willingness to bridge differences.

**General Advice for Mixed Marriages:**

*   **Eyes Wide Open:** Acknowledge the potential challenges honestly before
    marriage.
*   **Discuss Differences Thoroughly:** Talk openly about how you will handle
    specific areas of potential conflict (e.g., religion, children,
    finances, family).
*   **Strong Foundation:** Ensure the relationship is built on deep love,
    respect, and commitment, strong enough to withstand external pressures.
*   **Seek Support:** Connect with other mixed couples or seek premarital
    counseling specializing in intercultural/interfaith issues.
*   **United Front:** Present a united front to family and society regarding
    your choices.

Mixed marriages _can_ be successful and enriching, often bringing together
the best of different worlds. However, they typically require a higher
degree of awareness, communication, and problem-solving skills than
marriages between partners from similar backgrounds.




_Chapter XIV_

Nine Dangerous Characters


Certain personality types are notoriously difficult to live with and have a
high likelihood of creating an unhappy marriage. Recognizing these
“dangerous characters” before commitment can save immense heartache.

1.  **The Neurotic:** Chronically anxious, insecure, complaining, often
    suffering from various physical ailments with no organic cause.
    Requires constant reassurance, drains partner’s energy, finds fault
    easily. (See Test 23 in Chapter XV).

2.  **The Psychopath (Antisocial Personality):** Lacks conscience and
    empathy. Often charming superficially but is manipulative, dishonest,
    irresponsible, impulsive, and fails to learn from experience. Cannot
    form deep attachments.

3.  **The Alcoholic or Addict:** Primary loyalty is to alcohol or drugs.
    Behaviour is unpredictable, unreliable. Often involves lying,
    financial problems, emotional instability, and potential abuse.
    Marriage is unlikely to succeed unless the addiction is fully and
    permanently addressed (which requires professional help and strong
    personal commitment).

4.  **The Chronic Philanderer (Womanizer/Man-izer):** Compulsively seeks
    sexual conquests outside the relationship. Incapable of fidelity.
    Often linked to narcissism or deep insecurity.

5.  **The Emotionally Immature:** (Related to Neurotic, but broader) Acts
    like a child when frustrated. Needs constant attention, avoids
    responsibility, prone to tantrums or pouting, blames others for
    problems.

6.  **The Extreme Jealous/Possessive Type:** Suffocatingly controlling,
    suspicious without cause, monitors partner’s activities, isolates them
    from friends and family. Often stems from deep insecurity but creates
    an unbearable environment. Can escalate to abuse.

7.  **The Abuser (Physical, Verbal, or Emotional):** Uses violence,
    threats, insults, humiliation, or manipulation to control the partner.
    This behaviour rarely improves without intensive professional
    intervention and is often cyclical and escalating.

8.  **The Extreme Narcissist:** Grossly inflated sense of self-importance,
    requires constant admiration, lacks empathy, exploits others for
    personal gain. Sees partner as an extension of themselves or an object
    to enhance their status.

9.  **The Chronically Depressed/Pessimistic:** While clinical depression is
    an illness requiring treatment and support, marrying someone with
    untreated, severe, chronic depression or an unrelentingly negative and
    hopeless outlook on life can be extremely draining and difficult.

**Test 22: Are You Too Jealous?**

(Note: Test details omitted. Assesses tendency towards excessive jealousy
and possessiveness.)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Severity:** Many people have _traits_ of these types, but the danger
    lies in the extreme and persistent nature of the behaviour.
*   **Potential for Change:** Some conditions (like alcoholism or depression)
    can be treated, but require the individual’s acknowledgment of the
    problem and commitment to change, usually with professional help.
    Deep-seated personality disorders (like psychopathy or narcissism) are
    very difficult, often impossible, to change.
*   **Don’t Try to “Save” Them:** Entering a marriage hoping to reform or
    “save” someone with serious character flaws or addictions is usually a
    recipe for disaster.

Be extremely cautious if a potential partner exhibits significant signs of
these dangerous character types. Such relationships are highly likely to be
destructive and unhappy.




_Chapter XV_

People Who Should Not Marry At All


While marriage is suitable for most, there are some individuals whose
personality, health, or circumstances make them fundamentally unsuited for
the commitments and responsibilities of marriage, or at least make success
highly improbable.

**Categories to Consider:**

1.  **Individuals with Severe, Untreated Mental Illness:** Such as active
    schizophrenia, severe bipolar disorder, or profound personality
    disorders (like antisocial personality discussed previously). These
    conditions often involve inability to form stable relationships, poor
    reality testing, or potential danger to self or others. Marriage may
    be possible only if the illness is well-managed with ongoing treatment
    and the partner fully understands the challenges involved.

2.  **Active, Unreformed Addicts:** Individuals currently controlled by
    addiction to alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc., are generally incapable
    of the reliability, honesty, and commitment marriage requires. Recovery
    must come first.

3.  **Individuals with Certain Severe Hereditary Diseases:** In some cases,
    where there is a very high risk of passing on a devastating genetic
    disorder, individuals might choose not to marry or, if they do, not to
    have biological children. Genetic counseling is essential here.

4.  **Those Fundamentally Incapable of Commitment or Fidelity:** Individuals
    who consistently demonstrate an inability to remain faithful or committed
    in relationships.

5.  **Those with Extreme, Intractable Selfishness or Lack of Empathy:**
    Individuals (like extreme narcissists or psychopaths) who are utterly
    incapable of considering a partner’s needs or feelings.

6.  **Individuals with a Fixed Homosexual Orientation:** While societal
    views are changing, attempting to force oneself into a heterosexual
    marriage against one’s fundamental orientation is generally unfair to
    both partners and unlikely to lead to happiness.

7.  **Those Who Strongly Prefer Solitude:** Some rare individuals are
    genuinely content living alone and have no desire for the intimacy and
    shared life of marriage. Forcing themselves into marriage due to social
    pressure would be a mistake.

**Test 23: Is the Mate a Neurotic?**

(Note: Test details omitted. Provides a screening for significant neurotic
tendencies--chronic anxiety, insecurity, somatic complaints, etc.--which,
if severe, can make marriage very difficult.)

**Important Nuances:**

*   **Treatability:** Many conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, some
    addictions) are treatable. The issue is often not the condition
    itself, but the individual’s willingness to seek and comply with
    treatment.
*   **Severity:** The degree of the problem matters. Mild neurotic traits
    are common; severe, incapacitating illness is different.
*   **Partner’s Awareness and Capacity:** In some cases, a marriage might
    work if one partner has a chronic issue, provided the other partner is
    fully aware, emotionally strong, and willing to provide support without
    becoming a martyr.

This is not about labeling people but about recognizing situations where
the fundamental requirements for a healthy partnership--mutual care,
respect, reliability, commitment--are profoundly lacking or impossible due
to severe, unaddressed issues. In such cases, marriage is likely to bring
more suffering than joy, and choosing not to marry (or not to marry that
person) is the wiser course.




_Chapter XVI_

Will a Job Undermine Your Marriage?


This chapter revisits the question of married women working (also discussed
by Eleanor Roosevelt in Chapter IV), focusing on the potential impact on
marital harmony.

**Potential Problems When Wives Work:**

1.  **Husband’s Ego:** Some men feel inadequate or threatened if their wives
    work, especially if the wife earns more or has a more prestigious job.
    They may feel their role as primary provider is undermined.
2.  **Division of Household Labor:** Conflict often arises if the husband
    expects the wife to carry the full burden of housework and childcare in
    addition to her job (the “second shift”). Resentment builds if the
    division of labor is perceived as unfair.
3.  **Fatigue and Stress:** Juggling job, home, and family can be exhausting
    for the wife, leaving less energy for the relationship or personal
    well-being.
4.  **Childcare Concerns:** Worries about the quality and cost of childcare,
    or guilt about not being a full-time mother, can create stress.
5.  **Competition:** In rare cases, if partners are in the same field, unhealthy
    competition can develop.
6.  **Differing Schedules:** Conflicting work hours can limit time together.
7.  **Social Life:** Less time or energy for socializing as a couple.

**Potential Benefits When Wives Work:**

1.  **Improved Finances:** Reduced financial stress, ability to achieve
    goals (like buying a home) sooner.
2.  **Wife’s Fulfillment:** Increased self-esteem, intellectual stimulation,
    and personal satisfaction for the wife, which can positively impact her
    mood and the marriage.
3.  **Greater Equality:** More of a partnership model, with shared
    responsibilities and decision-making.
4.  **Broader Interests:** Wife brings outside perspectives and experiences
    into the marriage.
5.  **Security:** Provides a financial cushion if the husband loses his job
    or becomes ill.
6.  **Positive Role Model:** Can provide a positive role model for children,
    especially daughters, of female competence and independence.

**Making It Work:**

Whether a wife’s job undermines or strengthens a marriage depends largely
on the couple’s attitude and approach:

*   **Mutual Agreement:** The decision for the wife to work should ideally be
    a joint one, based on open discussion of pros and cons.
*   **Husband’s Support:** The husband’s attitude is crucial. He must respect
    his wife’s work and be willing to adjust his own role.
*   **Fair Division of Labor:** Housework and childcare must be shared
    equitably. This requires ongoing negotiation and cooperation.
*   **Good Communication:** Couples need to communicate effectively about
    schedules, stress levels, and needs.
*   **Prioritizing the Relationship:** Make conscious efforts to spend quality
    time together despite busy schedules.
*   **Reliable Childcare:** Secure, high-quality childcare arrangements are
    essential if children are involved.
*   **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust arrangements as family needs or job
    situations change.

**Conclusion:**

A wife’s job does not automatically undermine a marriage. It presents both
challenges and potential benefits. Success depends on the couple’s ability
to approach the situation as a team, with mutual respect, open
communication, shared responsibility, and a commitment to making their
partnership work.




_Chapter XVII_

The Veteran As a Mate


(Written in 1946, shortly after World War II, this chapter addresses the
specific challenges and considerations involved in marrying returning
veterans.)

**The Veteran’s Readjustment:**

Returning veterans face a significant period of readjustment to civilian
life after the intense and often traumatic experiences of war. This can
affect their suitability or readiness for marriage.

**Potential Challenges:**

1.  **Emotional Scars:** Many veterans carry emotional wounds (now often
    termed PTSD). They may suffer from anxiety, depression, nightmares,
    irritability, emotional numbness, or difficulty trusting others.
2.  **Changed Personality:** War experiences can change a person. They may
    seem different from the person their sweetheart or wife knew before the
    war--perhaps more cynical, restless, or withdrawn.
3.  **Difficulty Settling Down:** After the structure (or chaos) of military
    life, adjusting to the routines of civilian work and family life can be
    difficult. Some may feel restless or dissatisfied.
4.  **Communication Problems:** Veterans may find it hard to talk about their
    war experiences, leading to emotional distance.
5.  **Physical Disabilities:** Some veterans return with physical injuries
    that require ongoing care and adjustment for both the veteran and their
    spouse.
6.  **Employment Issues:** Finding suitable employment after military service
    can be challenging.
7.  **Substance Abuse:** Some may have developed problems with alcohol or
    drugs as a coping mechanism.
8.  **Hasty Marriages:** Marriages contracted hastily before or during the
    war, based on brief acquaintance, face high risks when couples try to
    build a life together under normal conditions.

**Advice for Potential Mates (or Wives) of Veterans:**

*   **Patience and Understanding:** Recognize that readjustment takes time.
    Be patient, supportive, and understanding of the challenges the veteran
    is facing.
*   **Encourage Communication (But Don’t Force):** Create a safe space for
    the veteran to talk about their experiences if and when they are ready,
    but don’t pressure them.
*   **Seek Information:** Learn about the potential psychological effects of
    combat and military service to better understand your partner’s
    behaviour.
*   **Encourage Professional Help:** If the veteran is struggling significantly
    with emotional issues, substance abuse, or readjustment, gently
    encourage them to seek professional help (e.g., from Veterans Affairs,
    doctors, counselors).
*   **Focus on the Present and Future:** While acknowledging the past, focus
    on building a shared future together.
*   **Maintain Your Own Well-being:** Provide support, but don’t neglect
    your own needs or become solely defined by the veteran’s problems.
*   **Realistic Expectations:** Don’t expect the veteran to be exactly the
    same person they were before the war. Allow for growth and change.
*   **Delay Marriage if Necessary:** If planning to marry a returning
    veteran, allow sufficient time for readjustment before making a final
    commitment. Ensure you are marrying the person as they are _now_, not
    just the memory of who they were.

**Conclusion:**

Marrying a veteran can be deeply rewarding, but it requires awareness of
the potential challenges related to their wartime experiences and
readjustment. Patience, understanding, strong communication, and a
willingness to seek help when needed are crucial for building a successful
marriage with someone who has served in the military, especially after
combat exposure.




_Chapter XVIII_

So You Agree to Marry: What Next?


The engagement period is more than just waiting for the wedding day; it’s
a crucial time for final preparations, both practical and emotional, for
the lifelong commitment ahead.

**Key Tasks During Engagement:**

1.  **Deepen Understanding:** Continue getting to know each other on a deeper
    level. Discuss expectations, values, hopes, and fears regarding all
    aspects of married life (finances, children, careers, in-laws,
    intimacy, etc.). Don’t avoid difficult topics.

2.  **Practical Planning:**
    *   **Wedding Plans:** Plan the wedding together, keeping it meaningful
        and within your budget. Don’t let wedding stress overshadow
        marriage preparation.
    *   **Financial Planning:** Full disclosure of finances. Create a joint
        budget. Decide on bank accounts and money management systems.
        Discuss attitudes towards saving and spending.
    *   **Housing:** Decide where you will live.
    *   **Legal Matters:** Obtain marriage license. Consider prenuptial
        agreements if significant assets are involved (though less common
        in 1946).

3.  **Health Preparations:**
    *   **Medical Examinations:** Both partners should have thorough physical
        check-ups, including blood tests (required in many states) and
        discussion of any health concerns.
    *   **Contraception:** Discuss family planning desires and methods with
        each other and a doctor.

4.  **Strengthen the Relationship:**
    *   **Communication Skills:** Practice resolving disagreements
        constructively.
    *   **Shared Experiences:** Continue spending quality time together in
        various situations.
    *   **Involve Families:** Spend time with each other’s families to build
        relationships and understand family dynamics.

5.  **Premarital Counseling:** Consider seeking counseling, even if there are
    no major problems. A counselor can facilitate discussions on key topics,
    help identify potential conflict areas, and teach communication skills.
    It’s especially important if there are significant doubts or disagreements.

6.  **Address Doubts:** Engagement is the final opportunity to reconsider.
    Pay attention to persistent doubts or “red flags.” It is far better to
    break an engagement, however painful, than to enter a marriage you are
    not sure about.

**The Purpose of Engagement:**

Engagement serves several purposes:

*   **Public Announcement:** Signals the couple’s intention to marry.
*   **Preparation Time:** Allows time for practical wedding planning and
    marriage preparation.
*   **Final Testing Period:** Provides a last chance to confirm compatibility
    and commitment before the final vows.

Use the engagement period wisely. Focus not just on the wedding day, but
on laying a strong foundation for the many years of marriage that follow.




_Chapter XIX_

Getting Ready for Married Intimacy


Sexual adjustment is a vital part of a happy marriage, yet many couples
approach their wedding night and early marital intimacy with anxiety,
ignorance, or unrealistic expectations. Proper preparation can ease the
transition and foster a fulfilling sexual relationship.

**Importance of Preparation:**

*   **Reduces Anxiety:** Knowledge dispels fear of the unknown.
*   **Corrects Misinformation:** Replaces myths and half-truths with accurate
    information.
*   **Fosters Healthy Attitudes:** Encourages viewing sex positively, as a
    natural and joyful expression of love within marriage.
*   **Facilitates Communication:** Makes it easier for couples to talk openly
    about their needs and desires.

**Key Areas of Preparation:**

1.  **Education:**
    *   **Anatomy and Physiology:** Understand the basics of male and female
        sexual anatomy and response.
    *   **The Sexual Response Cycle:** Learn about arousal, plateau, orgasm,
        and resolution.
    *   **Common Issues:** Be aware that initial adjustments (e.g., pain for
        the bride, premature ejaculation for the groom) are common and
        usually temporary.
    *   **Contraception:** Understand chosen methods of family planning.
    *   **Sources:** Read reputable books on marital sex written by doctors
        or qualified counselors. Consult a physician with specific questions.

2.  **Attitude Adjustment:**
    *   **Discard Negative Beliefs:** Consciously reject any lingering ideas
        that sex is dirty, shameful, or merely a duty.
    *   **Embrace Positivity:** View marital intimacy as a good, pleasurable,
        and important way to express love and deepen connection.
    *   **Patience:** Understand that sexual adjustment takes time and
        practice. Don’t expect perfection immediately.

3.  **Communication with Partner:**
    *   **Discuss Expectations:** Talk openly about what you both hope for
        and expect from your sexual relationship.
    *   **Share Fears and Concerns:** Voicing anxieties can help alleviate them.
    *   **Agree on Approach:** Discuss the importance of tenderness, patience,
        and communication, especially during the initial experiences.

4.  **Medical Consultation:**
    *   **Premarital Exam:** As mentioned before, this provides an opportunity
        to discuss sexual health, contraception, and any concerns with a
        doctor.
    *   **Addressing Physical Issues:** Identify and address any physical
        conditions that might interfere with intercourse.

**The Wedding Night and Beyond:**

*   **Don’t Over-Idealize:** The wedding night may be affected by fatigue,
    stress, or nervousness. Don’t put excessive pressure on it to be “perfect.”
*   **Focus on Tenderness and Communication:** Prioritize closeness, affection,
    and open communication over achieving orgasm immediately.
*   **Be Patient and Gentle:** Especially with the bride’s first experience.
*   **Continue Learning Together:** Sexual adjustment is an ongoing process.
    Continue to communicate, experiment, and learn about each other’s needs
    and desires throughout the marriage.

Getting ready for married intimacy involves acquiring knowledge, fostering
healthy attitudes, and communicating openly with your partner. This
preparation helps build a foundation for a sexual relationship that is
both physically satisfying and emotionally fulfilling, strengthening the
marital bond.




_Chapter XX_

Getting Off to a Good Start


The early weeks and months of marriage set the tone for the future. While
the “honeymoon phase” is often idealized, it’s also a critical period of
adjustment. Getting off to a good start involves navigating these initial
adjustments constructively.

**Key Principles for a Good Start:**

1.  **Realistic Expectations:** Understand that the initial bliss won’t last
    forever without effort. Expect adjustments and occasional disagreements.
    Don’t mistake the end of the honeymoon phase for the end of love.

2.  **Prioritize the Relationship:** Make time for each other amidst the
    demands of work, setting up a home, and social obligations. Continue
    “dating” each other.

3.  **Establish Healthy Communication Patterns:** From the beginning, practice
    talking openly, listening respectfully, and resolving conflicts
    constructively. Avoid letting small irritations build into major
    resentments.

4.  **Negotiate Roles and Responsibilities:** Discuss and agree on how
    household chores, finances, and other responsibilities will be shared.
    Be flexible and willing to renegotiate as needed.

5.  **Handle Finances Wisely:** Implement the budget and financial management
    plan you developed during engagement. Avoid impulsive spending that
    could lead to early debt and stress.

6.  **Navigate In-Law Relationships:** Establish healthy boundaries with both
    families. Present a united front as a couple. Avoid complaining about
    your spouse to your family.

7.  **Nurture Intimacy:** Continue to develop both emotional and physical
    intimacy. Be patient and communicative regarding sexual adjustment.
    Express affection and appreciation regularly.

8.  **Maintain Individuality:** While building a life together, allow space
    for individual interests, hobbies, and friendships.

9.  **Focus on the Positives:** Make an effort to notice and appreciate your
    partner’s good qualities and the positive aspects of your relationship.

10. **Seek Help Early if Needed:** If you encounter significant problems or
    persistent conflicts that you can’t resolve on your own, don’t wait
    until the situation becomes critical. Seek guidance from a trusted
    mentor couple, clergy, or professional marriage counselor.

**Common Early Adjustments:**

*   Merging daily habits and routines.
*   Adjusting to living together 24/7.
*   Learning to handle disagreements as a couple.
*   Sexual adjustment.
*   Managing joint finances.
*   Dealing with family expectations.

The first year of marriage is a foundation-building period. By approaching
it with realistic expectations, open communication, mutual respect, and a
willingness to compromise and work together, couples can navigate the
initial adjustments successfully and set their marriage on a path towards
lasting happiness.




After Thoughts


Marriage is the most intimate and demanding of human relationships. It
offers the potential for profound happiness and fulfillment, but also
carries the risk of deep pain and disappointment.

Success in marriage is not automatic. It doesn’t depend solely on finding
the “right” person, but also on _being_ the right person and on both
partners’ willingness to invest effort, commitment, and love into the
relationship.

Preparation is key. Understanding yourself, choosing a partner wisely based
on character and compatibility (not just infatuation), developing
communication skills, and entering marriage with realistic expectations
significantly improve the odds of success.

Marriage requires ongoing effort. Love needs to be nurtured through
affection, appreciation, shared time, and continued communication.
Conflicts need to be resolved constructively. Adjustments need to be made
as circumstances change.

While this book offers guidance based on research and clinical experience,
every marriage is unique. The principles discussed provide a framework, but
each couple must find their own way to apply them.

Don’t be discouraged by the challenges. A good marriage is worth working
for. It provides a sanctuary of love, support, and companionship in an
often difficult world, and remains the foundation for strong families and a
stable society.

Choose wisely, prepare thoroughly, and commit fully to making your
marriage a source of lasting joy and fulfillment.

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
