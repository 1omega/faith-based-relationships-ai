CHAPTER I

THE MUTUAL DISSATISFACTION OF THE SEXES


‘Woman is the lesser man.’

TENNYSON.

‘Woman is the equal of man--nay, his superior.’

ANON.

‘Woman is the opposite of man.’

WEININGER.


There is no doubt that the relations between the sexes in England to-day
are highly unsatisfactory. A feeling of discontent and mutual hostility is
rife. Men and women seem further apart than ever before. The old chivalry
is dead, the new respect is not yet born. Women are beginning to look upon
men as their natural enemies, men upon women as their natural prey. The
sex-antagonism is becoming more and more marked.

Why is this? What are the causes of this deplorable state of affairs?

There are many, but perhaps the chief cause is the growing independence of
woman. In the past, woman was economically dependent on man. Marriage was
her only career, her only means of livelihood. She had to please man, to
cater to his tastes, to flatter his vanity. She had to accept his
standards, his morals, his view of life. She was, in short, his chattel,
his property.

Now, things are changing. Woman is becoming economically independent. She
can earn her own living, choose her own career. She is no longer forced
into marriage as the only alternative to starvation or dependence on
relatives. She is beginning to think for herself, to form her own
opinions, to set her own standards.

This new independence naturally brings her into conflict with man. Man,
accustomed for centuries to dominate, resents this challenge to his
authority. He dislikes the competition of women in the professional and
industrial world. He is bewildered and angered by woman's refusal to
accept his traditional view of her place and function.

Woman, on her side, flushed with her newfound freedom, is often aggressive
and defiant. She is impatient of man's conservatism, contemptuous of his
prejudices. She tends to exaggerate her claims, to demand not merely
equality but superiority.

Another cause of friction is the change in moral standards. The old double
standard, which condoned in man what it condemned in woman, is breaking
down. Women are demanding the same freedom as men, not only economically
and politically, but morally as well. This claim, whether right or wrong,
inevitably leads to conflict and misunderstanding.

Furthermore, the conditions of modern life tend to separate the sexes.
Men and women work in different spheres, have different interests, lead
different lives. They meet less frequently, understand each other less
perfectly. The camaraderie, the easy companionship that should exist
between them, is often lacking.

Education, too, plays its part. Boys and girls are educated separately,
often on entirely different lines. They grow up ignorant of each other's
point of view, each sex regarding the other with a mixture of curiosity,
suspicion, and hostility.

What is the remedy? How can this mutual dissatisfaction be overcome?

First and foremost, by a frank recognition of the facts. We must face the
situation honestly, admit the existence of the conflict, and try to
understand its causes.

Then, we need a new conception of the relations between the sexes. We must
get rid of the old ideas of domination and submission, of inherent
superiority and inferiority. We must learn to regard men and women as
equal partners, different but complementary, each with their own special
contribution to make to life.

Co-education, from the earliest years, would do much to promote mutual
understanding and respect. If boys and girls grow up together, work and
play together, they will learn to know and appreciate each other as human
beings, not merely as members of the opposite sex.

Greater economic independence for women is essential. Only when woman is
no longer economically dependent on man can a truly equal partnership
exist between them.

A single moral standard for both sexes is another necessary reform. What
is wrong for woman cannot be right for man. Only on a basis of equal moral
responsibility can mutual respect be built.

Finally, we need more opportunities for men and women to meet on common
ground, to share interests and activities, to cultivate friendship and
camaraderie. The segregation of the sexes, whether in work or in play, is
unnatural and harmful.

The task is not easy. Prejudice, tradition, and ingrained habits of
thought stand in the way. But the goal--a relationship of mutual respect,
understanding, and cooperation between the sexes--is worth striving for.
Upon its achievement depends not only the happiness of individuals, but
the future progress of the race.




CHAPTER II

WHY MEN DON’T MARRY


‘Marriage is a lottery.’

OLD PROVERB.

‘Marriage is a mistake.’

MODERN CYNIC.


That many men nowadays hesitate to marry is an undeniable fact. Bachelors
abound, not only among the young and struggling, but among the mature and
prosperous. Why is this?

Various reasons are alleged, some economic, some social, some personal.

**Economic Reasons:**

1.  **The Cost of Living:** Marriage is expensive. Setting up a home,
    supporting a wife (who may or may not contribute to the income),
    raising children--all this requires a substantial and steady income.
    Many young men, faced with uncertain prospects and the high cost of
    modern life, feel they cannot afford to marry.
2.  **The Rising Standard of Comfort:** People demand more comfort, more
    luxury, than formerly. A man may be able to support himself in
    comfort, but hesitate to take on the burden of a family, which would
    mean sacrificing many of his personal pleasures and indulgences.
3.  **Women's Economic Independence:** Ironically, the fact that women can
    earn their own living sometimes acts as a deterrent to marriage. Men
    may feel less obligation to marry, knowing that women are no longer
    entirely dependent on them for support. Also, the competition of
    women in the workplace may make it harder for some men to achieve the
    financial stability they deem necessary for marriage.

**Social Reasons:**

1.  **The Availability of Alternatives:** Modern society offers many
    alternatives to marriage for companionship and sexual gratification.
    Men can find social life in clubs, friendships with both sexes, and
    casual relationships, without incurring the responsibilities of
    marriage.
2.  **The Fear of Divorce:** The prevalence of divorce makes men cautious.
    They see marriages breaking up all around them, and fear to risk their
    own happiness and financial security in an institution that seems so
    unstable.
3.  **The Decline of Traditional Values:** The religious and social
    sanctions that formerly upheld marriage have weakened. Marriage is
    less regarded as a sacred duty or a social necessity.

**Personal Reasons:**

1.  **Fear of Losing Freedom:** Many men cherish their independence and are
    reluctant to surrender it. They fear the restrictions, the compromises,
    the loss of personal liberty that marriage entails.
2.  **High Expectations of Women:** Modern women are often perceived as more
    demanding, less easily satisfied, than their grandmothers. Men may fear
    they cannot meet these expectations, either financially or emotionally.
3.  **Disillusionment with Women:** Some men, through unfortunate personal
    experiences or observation, become cynical about women and marriage.
    They may see women as mercenary, capricious, or untrustworthy.
4.  **Selfishness:** Some men are simply too selfish, too absorbed in their
    own comfort and pleasure, to be willing to make the sacrifices that
    marriage demands.
5.  **Homosexuality:** An increasing awareness and, in some circles, acceptance
    of homosexuality means that some men who might previously have entered
    into conventional marriages for social reasons now feel able to pursue
    relationships with other men.

**Is the Reluctance Justified?**

While some of the reasons for hesitating to marry are valid, others are
based on fear, selfishness, or misunderstanding. The economic difficulties
are real for many, but often exaggerated. The fear of losing freedom is
largely illusory; a happy marriage brings new freedoms and enrichments,
not just restrictions. The disillusionment with women is often based on
limited or biased experience.

Marriage, despite its challenges, remains for most people the most
natural and fulfilling way of life. It offers unique opportunities for
love, companionship, personal growth, and lasting happiness.

The reluctance of men to marry is a complex problem with deep roots in our
changing society. Addressing it requires not only economic adjustments but
also a re-evaluation of our attitudes towards marriage, freedom, and the
relationship between the sexes.




CHAPTER III

WHY WOMEN DON’T MARRY


‘It is not good that the man should be alone.’

GENESIS.

‘It is not good that the woman should be alone, either.’

MODERN COMMENTATOR.


If men are increasingly reluctant to marry, the same is true, though perhaps
to a lesser extent, of women. The “spinster,” once an object of pity or
ridicule, is now often a respected and self-sufficient member of the
community. Why do many modern women choose to remain single?

**Economic Independence:**

This is undoubtedly the primary factor. Woman is no longer economically
dependent on man. She can earn her own living, often in professions that
are interesting and well-paid. Marriage is no longer her only means of
support or social standing. She can afford to be more selective, to wait
for a partner who truly meets her ideals, or to remain single if such a
partner does not appear.

**Higher Expectations:**

Education and broader experience have raised women's expectations of
marriage. They are no longer content with a husband who merely provides
financial support. They look for companionship, intellectual sympathy,
shared interests, and emotional compatibility. They are less willing to
marry men who are their inferiors in education, refinement, or character.

**Fear of Losing Independence:**

Having tasted the sweets of freedom and self-reliance, many women are
reluctant to enter into a relationship that might involve subordination or
loss of individuality. They fear the domestic drudgery, the limitation of
interests, the absorption in household cares that marriage often seems to
entail.

**The Demands of a Career:**

Many women are deeply engaged in careers that they find fulfilling. They
may be unwilling to sacrifice their professional ambitions for marriage,
especially if marriage means giving up their work, as it often did in the
past (and sometimes still does).

**Disillusionment with Men:**

Just as some men become cynical about women, some women become disillusioned
with men. They may perceive men as selfish, inconsiderate, unfaithful, or
lacking in understanding. The behaviour of some men certainly gives ground
for this view.

**The Surplus of Women:**

In many Western countries, there is a numerical surplus of women over men,
particularly in certain age groups and social classes. Simple arithmetic
means that some women who might wish to marry cannot find suitable
partners.

**Fear of Childbirth:**

Though less openly discussed, the fear of the physical ordeal of childbirth
may deter some women from marriage, or at least from motherhood, which is
so closely linked with marriage in most people's minds.

**Higher Standards of Male Behaviour Demanded:**

Women are less tolerant than formerly of male vices such as drunkenness,
gambling, and infidelity. They expect a higher standard of conduct from
the men they marry.

**The Attractiveness of Single Life:**

The single woman of today can lead a full, interesting, and respected
life. She can have her own home, her circle of friends, her career, her
hobbies. She is not necessarily lonely or unfulfilled.

**Is This Trend Desirable?**

From the individual woman's point of view, the freedom to choose whether or
not to marry is undoubtedly a gain. It is better to remain single than to
enter into an unhappy or unsuitable marriage.

From the point of view of society and the race, however, the reluctance of
many capable and intelligent women to marry and have children may be a
cause for concern. If the best and most independent women remain single,
the quality of the next generation may suffer.

The solution lies not in forcing women back into dependence, but in making
marriage a more equal and attractive partnership. Men must learn to respect
women's independence and individuality. Marriage must be flexible enough
to accommodate women's careers and interests. The burdens of housework and
childcare must be shared more equitably.

When marriage offers women not subordination and drudgery, but a true
partnership based on love, respect, and shared responsibility, then fewer
women will choose to remain single.




CHAPTER IV

THE TRAGEDY OF THE UNDESIRED


‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.’

GRAY.


Amidst all the discussion about why men and women don't marry, we must not
forget the silent tragedy of those who long for marriage but remain
unmarried through no fault or choice of their own--the undesired.

These are the women (and men, though perhaps fewer) whom fate seems to
have passed by. They may possess many admirable qualities--kindness,
intelligence, loyalty, domestic skills--but lack the superficial charm or
physical attractiveness that society often prizes. Or they may be hampered
by shyness, lack of opportunity, or unfortunate circumstances.

**The Plight of the Unmarried Woman:**

Society has traditionally been harsher towards the unmarried woman than the
unmarried man. The term "old maid" carries a sting that "bachelor" lacks.
While the economic independence of women has alleviated the financial
hardship of spinsterhood, the emotional and social challenges remain.

The undesired woman often suffers from a deep sense of failure and
incompleteness. She longs for the love, companionship, and security of
marriage, for a home and children of her own. She sees her friends marry
and settle down, while she is left behind.

Loneliness is often her constant companion. While she may have friends and
relatives, they cannot fully replace the intimacy and shared life of a
spouse. Social life can be difficult; she may feel like a "fifth wheel" at
couples' gatherings.

The maternal instinct, strong in most women, remains unfulfilled, leading
to frustration and sometimes bitterness. She may lavish affection on pets,
other people's children, or charitable causes, seeking an outlet for her
nurturing impulses.

Economic insecurity can still be a problem, especially in later life. The
single woman often lacks the financial cushion and support system that
marriage provides.

**What Can Be Done?**

Society needs to change its attitude towards the unmarried. Spinsterhood
should not be regarded as a failure or a stigma. The single woman should
be valued for her contributions to the community, her professional
achievements, and her personal qualities.

Opportunities for social interaction between the sexes should be increased.
The segregation of men and women in work and leisure limits the chances of
suitable partnerships being formed.

Education should prepare girls not only for careers but also for a full and
meaningful life, whether married or single. They should be encouraged to
develop interests, hobbies, and friendships that will sustain them
throughout life.

For the undesired woman herself, the path lies not in bitterness or
self-pity, but in building a rich and satisfying life despite her
disappointment. This may involve:

*   **Cultivating Friendships:** Building strong bonds with both men and
    women.
*   **Developing Interests:** Pursuing hobbies, further education, travel,
    or artistic activities.
*   **Finding Fulfilling Work:** Engaging in a career that provides
    satisfaction and purpose.
*   **Service to Others:** Volunteering or engaging in work that benefits
    the community can provide an outlet for nurturing impulses and a sense
    of usefulness.
*   **Adoption or Fostering:** For some, providing a home for a child in
    need can fulfill the maternal instinct.

The tragedy of the undesired is real and poignant. While society can do
more to alleviate their plight, ultimately, the courage and resilience to
build a meaningful life rests with the individual.




PART II

CAUSES OF FAILURE


‘Marriages are made in heaven.’

OLD SAYING.

‘Yes, and so are thunder and lightning.’

MODERN ADDITION.




CHAPTER I

THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MARRIAGE


‘Marriage is not a word, but a sentence.’

ANON.


Not all marriages are alike. They differ widely in their motives, their
foundations, and their outcomes. Understanding these variations can help
us identify the causes of failure and the conditions for success.

We may classify marriages roughly as follows:

1.  **The Marriage of Convenience (Mariage de Convenance):**
    *   **Motive:** Primarily practical considerations--wealth, social
        status, family connections, political alliance.
    *   **Foundation:** Mutual advantage, social suitability, family
        approval. Love and personal inclination may be secondary or absent.
    *   **Outcome:** Can be stable and socially successful if both partners
        accept the terms and fulfill their obligations. Often lacks deep
        emotional intimacy. May lead to unhappiness if personal feelings
        are completely disregarded.

2.  **The Passionate Marriage:**
    *   **Motive:** Intense physical attraction, overwhelming romantic love
        (often "love at first sight").
    *   **Foundation:** Sexual chemistry, idealization of the partner.
    *   **Outcome:** Often unstable. Passion tends to cool over time. If not
        supported by deeper compatibility and shared values, the marriage
        may collapse when the initial infatuation fades. Can be intensely
        happy initially, but prone to jealousy and conflict.

3.  **The Companionship Marriage:**
    *   **Motive:** Desire for companionship, shared interests, mutual
        support, friendship.
    *   **Foundation:** Compatibility of temperament, shared values and
        goals, mutual respect and affection.
    *   **Outcome:** Generally stable and enduring. Provides emotional
        security and contentment. May sometimes lack intense passion, but
        offers lasting satisfaction. This is often considered the ideal
        basis for modern marriage.

4.  **The Habitual Marriage:**
    *   **Motive:** Drifting into marriage through long association, social
        pressure, or lack of alternatives. Often follows a long, uninspired
        engagement.
    *   **Foundation:** Inertia, habit, convenience.
    *   **Outcome:** Often dull and unfulfilling. May be stable simply
        because neither partner has the energy or courage to change things.
        Lacks vitality and deep connection.

5.  **The Duty Marriage:**
    *   **Motive:** Sense of duty or obligation (e.g., pregnancy, fulfilling
        a promise, family pressure).
    *   **Foundation:** External compulsion rather than internal desire.
    *   **Outcome:** Highly variable. Can succeed if love and respect develop
        over time. Often fraught with resentment and unhappiness if the
        sense of obligation remains the primary bond.

6.  **The Reparative Marriage:**
    *   **Motive:** Seeking to repair personal deficits or escape an unhappy
        past (e.g., marrying to escape a difficult family situation, seeking
        a partner to provide qualities one lacks).
    *   **Foundation:** Psychological need, often unconscious.
    *   **Outcome:** Risky. Depends on whether the underlying psychological
        issues are resolved. May place unrealistic expectations on the
        partner.

**The Ideal Marriage?**

No single category perfectly describes most marriages, which often contain
elements of several types. However, the most successful and fulfilling
marriages generally combine elements of passion, companionship, and shared
values.

*   They begin with genuine love and attraction (passion).
*   They are built on a strong foundation of friendship, mutual respect, and
    shared interests (companionship).
*   They involve a commitment to shared goals and values, and a willingness
    to work through difficulties together (partnership).

Understanding the primary motive and foundation of a marriage can help
couples recognize potential pitfalls and consciously cultivate the elements
needed for lasting success. A marriage based solely on convenience or
passion is less likely to endure than one built on the broader foundation
of companionship and shared commitment.




CHAPTER II

WHY WE FALL OUT: DIVERS DISCORDS


‘The course of true love never did run smooth.’

SHAKESPEARE.


Even the best marriages experience conflict. Disagreements are inevitable
when two distinct individuals share their lives. The key to marital success
lies not in avoiding conflict altogether, but in learning to handle it
constructively. What are the common sources of discord?

1.  **Money:** Perhaps the most frequent battleground. Disagreements arise
    over:
    *   **Spending Habits:** One partner is a saver, the other a spender.
    *   **Priorities:** Differing views on what is important to spend money
        on (e.g., house vs. travel, practical needs vs. luxuries).
    *   **Control:** Who manages the money? Who makes the major financial
        decisions?
    *   **Income Differences:** Resentment or power struggles if one partner
        earns significantly more than the other.
    *   **Debt:** How to handle pre-existing or jointly acquired debt.

2.  **Sex:** Intimacy is crucial, and problems here can poison the entire
    relationship. Issues include:
    *   **Differing Levels of Desire:** One partner wants sex more often than
        the other.
    *   **Lack of Satisfaction:** Physical or emotional dissatisfaction for
        one or both partners.
    *   **Poor Communication:** Inability to talk openly about sexual needs
        and preferences.
    *   **Infidelity:** Betrayal of trust through affairs.
    *   **Using Sex as a Weapon:** Withholding sex to punish or control.

3.  **Children:** Raising children brings joy but also stress and potential
    conflict over:
    *   **Discipline:** Differing approaches to setting rules and enforcing
        consequences.
    *   **Values:** Disagreements on religious upbringing, education, or
        moral standards to instill.
    *   **Time and Attention:** Feeling that one partner is not doing their
        fair share of childcare.
    *   **Impact on Couple:** Neglecting the marital relationship due to focus
        on children.

4.  **In-laws:** Interference or criticism from parents or other relatives
    can cause significant tension. Problems arise from:
    *   **Divided Loyalties:** Feeling caught between spouse and family of
        origin.
    *   **Criticism:** In-laws criticizing spouse's housekeeping, parenting,
        or career.
    *   **Over-dependence:** One partner remaining too emotionally or
        financially tied to their parents.
    *   **Boundary Issues:** Difficulty establishing the couple as an
        independent unit.

5.  **Household Chores:** The division of labour, especially in dual-career
    couples, is a common source of friction. Resentment builds if one
    partner feels they are doing an unfair share.

6.  **Communication Breakdown:** This underlies many other conflicts.
    Problems include:
    *   **Not Listening:** Interrupting, dismissing feelings, failing to pay
        attention.
    *   **Criticism and Blame:** Attacking the partner's character instead of
        addressing the issue.
    *   **Defensiveness:** Refusing to accept responsibility or consider the
        partner's viewpoint.
    *   **Stonewalling:** Withdrawing, refusing to discuss problems.
    *   **Assumptions and Mind-reading:** Assuming you know what the partner
        thinks or feels without asking.

7.  **Differing Needs and Personalities:**
    *   **Introvert vs. Extrovert:** Differing needs for social interaction
        and solitude.
    *   **Neatness vs. Messiness:** Clashing habits regarding household order.
    *   **Time Management:** Punctuality vs. tardiness.
    *   **Expression of Affection:** Different ways of showing and receiving
        love.

8.  **External Stressors:** Job pressures, financial worries, illness, or
    other life crises can put a strain on the marriage and shorten tempers.

**Handling Discord:**

Successful couples learn to:

*   **Address issues promptly** before resentment builds.
*   **Communicate respectfully**, even when angry.
*   **Focus on finding solutions**, not winning arguments.
*   **Compromise** and respect differences.
*   **Seek professional help** if conflicts become persistent or destructive.

Understanding the common sources of marital discord is the first step
towards preventing or resolving them constructively.




CHAPTER III

THE AGE TO MARRY


‘Marry in haste, repent at leisure.’

OLD PROVERB.


Is there an ideal age to marry? Statistics and experience suggest that
both very early and very late marriages have particular risks, while
marriages contracted in the mid-twenties tend to have the highest success
rate.

**Risks of Very Early Marriage (Teens and Early Twenties):**

1.  **Immaturity:** Partners may lack the emotional maturity, life
    experience, and self-knowledge needed to make a wise choice of partner
    or navigate the complexities of marriage.
2.  **Unformed Personalities:** Individuals are still developing their
    identities, values, and goals. Partners chosen in youth may not be
    compatible later in life as individuals grow and change.
3.  **Financial Instability:** Young couples often struggle financially,
    lacking established careers and savings. Financial stress can strain
    the relationship.
4.  **Interrupted Education/Career:** Early marriage, especially if followed
    quickly by children, can curtail educational and career opportunities,
    particularly for women.
5.  **Higher Divorce Rate:** Statistically, marriages contracted by teenagers
    have a significantly higher risk of divorce than those contracted later.

**Risks of Very Late Marriage (Late Thirties and Beyond):**

1.  **Set Ways:** Individuals may have become accustomed to their independence
    and find it difficult to adjust to the compromises and shared life of
    marriage. Habits and routines may be deeply ingrained and hard to change.
2.  **Reduced Flexibility:** Older individuals may be less adaptable and less
    willing to accommodate a partner's needs or preferences.
3.  **Difficulties with Childbearing:** Fertility declines with age,
    particularly for women. Older parents may also have less energy for
    raising young children.
4.  **Smaller Pool of Potential Partners:** The number of available and
    suitable single partners decreases with age.
5.  **Established Social Circles:** Integrating into a partner's established
    social life, or merging two separate social circles, can be challenging.
