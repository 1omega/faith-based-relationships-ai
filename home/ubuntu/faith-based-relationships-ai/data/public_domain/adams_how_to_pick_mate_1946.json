    "content_summary": "A 1946 guide offering advice on selecting a suitable marriage partner based on psychological principles and research available at the time. Covers topics like readiness for marriage, distinguishing love from infatuation, assessing personality traits and compatibility using tests, potential problems like mixed marriages and difficult personalities, and preparing for marital intimacy and early adjustments. Includes specific advice regarding returning WWII veterans.",
    "content_detailed": "The book systematically addresses mate selection, starting with reasons for marrying and assessing one's readiness (age, emotional maturity). It contrasts love and infatuation, discusses sexual development and the risks of premarital/extramarital sex. It provides advice on attracting a partner and evaluating crucial personality traits (sociability, stability, dependability, etc.) in both oneself and a potential mate using included tests. The authors emphasize compatibility assessment, covering values, interests, temperament, and background, offering tests for prediction. It warns about challenges in mixed marriages (interfaith, interracial, age gap, class difference) and identifies 'dangerous characters' (neurotics, addicts, abusers, etc.) unsuitable for marriage. Specific chapters address the impact of working wives and the readjustment challenges for returning WWII veterans. The book concludes with guidance on the engagement period, preparing for sexual intimacy, and navigating the crucial first year of marriage.",
