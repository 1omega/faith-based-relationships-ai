Expecting a spouse to fulfill you leads to disappointment.\n- theological_insight: Christian marriage unites two flawed people, held together by a faithful God.\n- theological_insight: God created marriage to reflect Christ\"s love for the church (Eph. 5:25, 32-33).\n- advice: Prioritize \"we\" over \"me\"; marriage embodies selfless love, not just personal fulfillment.\n- theological_insight: Love is patient (1 Cor 13:4); marriage requires resilient patience through difficult seasons, reflecting God\"s long-suffering love (2 Pet. 3:8-9).\n- theological_insight: Marriage is a sacred covenant, not just a contract, reflecting God\"s everlasting covenant with His people (Gen 2:24, Eph 5:32).\n- theological_insight: Biblical roles (Eph 5:22-24) are counter-cultural. Husband\"s headship means sacrificial love like Christ; wife\"s submission is a response to that love.\n- theological_insight: Ephesians 5 critiques \"traditional\" gender roles that privilege men; in the gospel drama, the wife\"s needs come first, and the husband\"s self-interest is cut down.\n- theological_insight: These self-giving postures (sacrifice, submission) are impossible without the Holy Spirit\"s enabling power.",
