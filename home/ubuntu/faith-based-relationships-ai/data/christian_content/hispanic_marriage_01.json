    "content_detailed": "As a Hispanic child, I saw my grandmother sew many things. She was a prolific seamstress with an eye for detail. I once asked her, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier if you just stacked all the multicolored fabric pieces and cut them all at once?\u201d\n\nIn my na\u00efvet\u00e9, I thought it would save time. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d my grandmother told me, \u201ceach dress needs special attention. The designer wants us to follow the pattern.\u201d\n\nHispanic marriage is all about tradition. Generation after generation, we honor the traditions passed down to us. To question them would be to dishonor our culture, our family, our identity. But what if a pattern is wrong? What if it\u2019s not the pattern our designer wants us to follow?\n\nTo be honest, it took me years to discover what biblical marriage looked like in a Hispanic context. Early on, I realized that the patterns my family, ancestors, and many other Hispanics in my community followed were extremely harmful to women. Of course, ours is not the only patriarchal culture, but in my context, it was hard to find a biblical alternative.\n\nI found little solace in Hispanic churches. Most promoted a hierarchical pattern that didn\u2019t respect the beautiful image of God within women. Legalism is still prevalent in many Hispanic churches across denominations, and women are taught at an early age to be hyper-submissive to men.\n\nThe egalitarian movement called for mutual leadership in the home and church. But it was focused on white Americans\u2014their culture, values, and priorities. For example, white women may fight to work outside the home, but that fight doesn\u2019t help women of color. Because of economic inequality tied to racism, women of color in the US have always worked outside the home. We fight to get the same economic freedom white women already have! When I looked to egalitarianism for help on marriage, what I found was only about European-American marriage. I had to find my own way.\n\nWhat does a biblical marriage pattern look like in a Hispanic context?\n\n**1. Reframe marriage around collaboration**\n\nAs a Hispanic woman, I\u2019ve observed that even Hispanics that don\u2019t attend church know one thing about the Bible: headship. In other words, \u201cthe man is in charge.\u201d This fits with _machismo_, a kind of hyper-patriarchy that infects many Hispanic families. And it is enforced through culture and expectations. Boys and men are told things like \u201cDon\u2019t let your wife push you around!\u201d while girls are taught to be subservient, not to push back against anything men do or say. When a wife gets \u201cout of hand,\u201d her husband is expected to enforce his dominance, even abusively.\n\nCan this be the Bible\u2019s pattern or God\u2019s design? Can abuse be acceptable to our designer? No!\n\nThe big myth about egalitarianism is that it\u2019s about making men subservient and putting women in charge. But this is not true. It is all about collaboration. In the Bible, headship is all about sacrifice. It is about the husband giving up dominance in favor of collaboration. He is to lay down his own pride and desires. That doesn\u2019t mean he is subservient, but neither is she. Women can speak for themselves and should not endure abuse. Biblical headship means husbands and wives submit to each other, and they work together as partners.\n\nMy husband and I got married young. We went to college together and took classes on social justice. We chose to break generational patterns that were abusive and sinful. We chose instead to base our relationship and family dynamics on the biblical idea of collaboration. I am a church planter, which means I am very busy. I don\u2019t have time to do all the work around the house, so we share it. Ironing, vacuuming, taking the kids to school and picking them up\u2014these are all tasks that we share. We taught our sons how to cook, clean, vacuum, and do anything else that was needed. My husband and kids did the grocery shopping. They learned that in our home, we all work together.\n\nWe established a pattern of joint decision-making and leadership. When our kids asked one of us for something, we\u2019d respond with, \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it and get back to you.\u201d When they came home spewing patriarchal ideas they learned, we\u2019d challenge them to think critically about what they were saying. Years later, we still do.\n\n**2. Be ready to explain**\n\nWhen you are committed to mutuality, people notice. You need to be prepared to respond to a lot of different situations.\n\nPeople will ask questions, and you need to be prepared to answer them. Over the years, people have asked my husband \u201chow could your marriage work? Your wife is a pastor! How can that be?\u201d He simply responds that it works because we collaborate. We\u2019re partners.\n\nPeople will make assumptions that you need to correct. At my first church planting meeting, someone approached my husband and said, \u201cGreat to have you here, pastor\u201d when I was standing right there. My husband said, \u201cOh, you think I\u2019m the pastor? Why did you assume I was the pastor? I am not the pastor, my wife is, and she is a church planter. Let me introduce you to Pastor Gricel.\u201d\n\nPeople used to pull my husband aside and tell him that he should be the pastor. That the only reason I was the pastor is because he was disobedient to his call, so I had to step in. But he\u2019s very proud to say that I am the pastor, not him. Now, whenever I go to speak at a church, they finally know that I\u2019m the pastor.\n\nPeople will be surprised by what you do, but you can make an impact. I am smart, opinionated, and fearless. I have become very aware that when I say something that sounds remotely like a challenge to a man, it really surprises women around me. They shrink back and get bug-eyed, as if to say \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d At the same time, they gain courage by seeing me stand up for myself. They see that I reasoned with a man, and I didn\u2019t get hurt. Next time, maybe they\u2019ll be bold enough to speak up, too.\n\n**3. Be an advocate in your context**\n\nYou may not be bold and vocal, and you might not be a leader. That\u2019s okay; you can still share the biblical pattern of marriage in your own context. Before I found my voice, I was able to advocate through marriage counseling. When I counseled couples, I encouraged men to collaborate by reminding them things like, \u201cThese kids are both of yours, not just hers,\u201d and \u201cYou may be tired, but so is your wife. You have to collaborate. You can mow the lawn, but you still need to work with her on things inside the house, too.\u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d I reminded husbands, \u201cIf you really want to have sex with your wife, it would be to your advantage if she weren\u2019t so tired!\u201d\n\nWhen men were hurting their wives, I\u2019d ask, \u201cIs your wife a daughter of the king? Is she made in God\u2019s image?\u201d They\u2019d look confused. \u201cWhen you lose your temper, who are you hurting? Not just her; you\u2019re hurting God when you hurt his daughter!\u201d Then they began to understand. I explained that men had rights and power, but so do women. It\u2019s not about taking power for yourself; it\u2019s about using your power to collaborate.\n\nI didn\u2019t bring up feminism or egalitarianism by name. I talked about the concepts, and I explained how they are God\u2019s pattern. I helped them see how this pattern improved life for everyone. You don\u2019t have to know all the answers to be an advocate, you just need to have conversations. You can change lives!\n\n**4. Value relationships**\n\nWhen we choose a kind of marriage relationship that looks different from others in our churches or our extended family, it can strain relationships. People question us. They\u2019ll say we\u2019re disobeying God. We need to stay strong, but we also need to stay engaged with these people. It is easier to cut yourself off (and sometimes that is necessary for our own safety or health). But we need relationships with people that we disagree strongly with. We can say, \u201cLet me show you how I see this issue,\u201d but it has to be done with mutuality and respect. We need to be willing to listen, too. When we do this, we show people that we value them, even when we disagree. And we show them that we are committed to the biblical pattern of collaboration, not just in marriage, but in all our relationships.\n\nThis article appears in \u201cIntersectionality,\u201d the Summer 2017 issue of Mutuality magazine.
