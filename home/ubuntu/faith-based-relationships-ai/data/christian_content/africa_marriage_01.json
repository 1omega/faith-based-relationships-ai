    "content_detailed": "Marriage is the most important relationship you can have with another person. It is an intimate and life-changing social institution. In our cultures, a person who is married is usually considered to be a mature and responsible adult. Most of us desire to marry and raise children. The [Tiv people of Nigeria]() have a proverb: Inyon _purugh kperegh mom ga,_ \u201cA bird does not fly with one wing.\u201d Hence, a person needs a partner with whom to share life.\n\nBut when marriage is elusive or when Christians remain [single by choice](), they can spend much time working for God. Often singles do great works for God (see [1 Corinthians 7:32-35]().) Others choose to marry so that they can work for God together, as husband and wife ([Psalm 34:3]()).\n\n### Divine Origin of Marriage\n\nMarriage was created by God. The family is the basic unit of society. When God created man and woman, he said, \u201cA man [leaves his father and mother]() and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one\u201d ([Genesis 2:24]()). When a man and woman marry, they become one. The husband\u2019s number-one relative and number one love is his wife. The wife\u2019s number-one relative and number-one love is her husband.\n\nMarriage is a reflection of the nature of God himself. God (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit) created human beings (male and female) in \u201cour image\u201d ([Genesis 1:26]()). Men and women, whether married or not, have a purpose in God\u2019s agenda. But should they decide to marry, they should be united in serving the Lord together in their families and in their ministry.\n\nMarriage can also be compared to the image of Christ and the church ([Ephesians 5:21-32]()). Just as a couple on their wedding day is fully married, believers are fully children of God on the day they become Christians. Just as a couple will grow together and become more like each other over the years, a Christian will become more like Christ over the years. And just as a person should be faithful to his or her spouse, a Christian should be faithful to [Christ, our bridegroom]() ([2 Corinthians 11:2-3]()).\n\n### What Is \u201cMarriage\u201d?\n\nThe word marriage is used to talk about three different things. They are related, but not quite the same.\n\nPrior to the introduction of Western Christianity, Africans had [traditional marriage](), which involved the extended family participating in courtship, payment of dowry, and betrothal. Christianity and Western education introduced two additional forms of marriages: court marriage and church marriage.\n\nThe court form of marriage is created by the state. The bride and groom and family representatives declare the marriage union before a court registrar and sign a document, authenticating the marriage. The court keeps a copy of the signed document.\n\nA church marriage affirms the authority of God over a marriage union. Some Christians view marriage as [a sacrament](). In a church marriage, a bride and groom agree that God is Lord over their marriage. They publicly declare their marriage vows before God and the church. A church wedding does not have to be an expensive ceremony. It would be better to have a simple wedding with a Christian blessing and fewer guests than to delay the marriage for many years in order to make it as lavish as some of our relatives might want, which could lead to temptation to have [premarital sex]().\n\n#### African Traditional Marriage\n\nA traditional marriage is a commitment before the couple\u2019s family and [ethnic group](). A court marriage is a commitment before the couple\u2019s government. A church marriage is a couple\u2019s commitment before God and the people of God, who should agree to support the couple.\n\nThere is no harm for a Christian to participate in a [traditional marriage]() or a court marriage, because the authority of government is recognised by the Bible. But only the Bible can define marriage for a Christian. We read in [Genesis 2:24]() that because God created man and woman, a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.\n\n#### Polygamy\n\nSome Africans traditionally embraced polygamous marriage relationships, in which one husband marries two or more wives. Much less common is polyandry, in which one wife marries two or more husbands. Neither polygamy nor polyandry is encouraged in the Bible. Paul tells Timothy to teach that an elder should have one wife ([1 Timothy 3:2]()). Polygamy or polyandry cannot be part of holy matrimony, a church marriage. Just because Old Testament men such as Jacob, David, and Solomon were polygamists does not mean God endorses polygamy. David, for instance, was also guilty of murder and adultery and God does not endorse those. Today, Christians who were polygamists before becoming believers should pray and seek God\u2019s guidance on how to treat their wives lovingly so that their marriage life will glorify God.\n\nSome African governments, which regulate court marriages, allow marriage between a man and a man or a woman and a woman. This is contrary to the teaching of the Bible, which says a marriage is to be between a man and a woman ([Matthew 19:4-6]()). And just because some Western or African governments allow homosexual marriages does not make them marriages in God\u2019s eyes.\n\n### Getting Ready for Marriage\n\nBecause marriage was ordained by God, and because the family is the basic unit of society, a young man and a young woman going into marriage must be prepared. The best preparation is to learn from a good example of godly marriages of parents and others in the community. If love, faithfulness, respect, and helpfulness in marriage are modelled by the older generation, they will be learned by the younger generation. The church can also create [courses on marriage]() that will help young couples to be more prepared to enter into this covenant.\n\n#### Sex Before Marriage & Co-Habitation\n\nYoung people should wait to have sex until they are married. It is a sin to have sex before marriage. God will bless a marriage where the bride and groom have chosen to remain virgins until their wedding day. If you are a Christian and you have engaged in sex without marriage, confess it and stop doing it. God will give you power to overcome that temptation ([2 Corinthians 5:17]()).\n\nAnd do not live together without marrying. Some girls say, \u201cA wonderful man wants to marry me next year. May I begin staying with him now?\u201d [1 Thessalonians 4:3]() gives the answer: \u201cGod\u2019s will is for you to be holy, so stay away from all sexual sin.\u201d There are men who stay with one girl for weeks or years but then leave her and stay with another and then another without marrying any of them.\n\n#### Pre-Marital Counselling\n\nNo matter how well prepared a man and woman think they are for marriage, it is wise to receive premarital guidance from a pastor or a counsellor. Such counselling sessions uncover the bride and groom\u2019s assumptions about marriage and life together. Some of the issues that should be discussed before marriage include: Are we both willing to serve Christ together? Do we agree on [how to handle money]()? Will we both spend time training and nurturing our children? What will we do if God does not give us children? Should either of us get more education? Do we agree on money, sex, relatives, and friends?\n\nDuring such sessions, a couple may learn each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. If they discover that they are not compatible, they may terminate the courtship. The pastor or counsellor should help the couple through this difficult time.\n\n### Building a Healthy Marriage\n\nMarriage is a complex relationship, and building a healthy marriage involves facing many challenges. This is why the commitment a husband and wife make to each other before their family and ethnic group, before a representative of their government, and before God and the people of God is so important. When a person becomes a Christian, there is [no promise that the Christian life will be easy](). But Jesus promises to be with us always ([Matthew 28:20]()).\n\nOne way to build a healthy marriage is for Christian spouses to work together for God. Even if they do not have a high position in the church, they can serve God in their family and community. They can pray together, study the Bible together, and encourage each other in their faith. They can also serve others together, such as visiting the sick, helping the poor, or teaching children about God.\n\nAnother way to build a healthy marriage is to communicate well. Husbands and wives should talk to each other honestly and respectfully. They should listen to each other\u2019s feelings and needs. They should also forgive each other when they make mistakes ([Ephesians 4:32]()).\n\nFinally, building a healthy marriage requires commitment. Marriage is not always easy, and there will be times when couples face difficulties. But if they are committed to each other and to God, they can overcome any challenge. They can trust God to help them grow in love and faithfulness ([Philippians 4:13]()).",
