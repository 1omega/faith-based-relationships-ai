    "content_detailed": "- theological_insight: Proverbs imparts God\"s wisdom for life and marriage, using parallels and couplets for memorability.\n- theological_insight: Wisdom requires paying attention, inclining our ears, grasping truth, and internalizing it, primarily through time spent in God\"s Word.\n- advice: Observe discretion and reserve knowledge (Prov 5:2); speak with kindness and a level head, knowing when and what to say (cf. Prov 17:3).\n- theological_insight: Seduction often uses smooth, deceptive language (Prov 5:3-4), which ultimately leads to bitterness and destruction (\"sharp as a two-edged sword\").\n- theological_insight: The path of the adulteress leads to death (Sheol) and instability; she does not ponder the path of life (Prov 5:5-6).\n- advice: Keep your way far from the seductress; do not go near the door of her house (Prov 5:8). Avoidance is crucial prevention.\n- theological_insight: Giving your vigor and years to others/the cruel (Prov 5:9-10) through adultery leads to ruin, regret, and bankruptcy (Prov 5:11-14).\n- theological_insight: The antidote for adultery is a godly, sexually intimate marriage relationship (Prov 5:15-19). Drink water from your own cistern.\n- theological_insight: Rejoice in the wife of your youth (Prov 5:18); be intoxicated always with her love (Prov 5:19).\n- theological_insight: Christian marriage reflects God\"s design from Genesis 2, culminating in the relationship between Christ and His bride, the church (Ephesians 5).\n- theological_insight: God\"s design for intimacy in marriage is a blessing far beyond anything the world offers (Prov 5:18-19).\n- theological_insight: A person\"s ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and He ponders all his paths (Prov 5:21). Accountability to God is constant.\n- theological_insight: The wicked are snared by their own iniquities and held fast by the cords of their sin (Prov 5:22).",
