Polygamy/polyandry are not endorsed, despite OT examples or cultural practices (1 Tim 3:2). Homosexual marriage is contrary to biblical teaching (Matt 19:4-6).\n- advice: Preparation for marriage involves learning from godly examples and church courses.\n- advice: Wait for sex until marriage (1 Thess 4:3); do not cohabitate before marriage.\n- advice: Receive premarital guidance/counseling to discuss key issues (faith, money, children, relatives, sex, education).\n- theological_insight: Building a healthy marriage involves commitment before family, government, and God.\n- theological_insight: God wants husband and wife to enjoy sex together (Prov 5:18-20) and avoid adultery (Heb 13:4).",
