Husbands should lay down pride and desires for partnership.\n- theological_insight: Biblical marriage involves mutual submission and working together as partners (collaboration).\n- advice: Establish a pattern of joint decision-making and leadership within the marriage.\n- advice: Share household tasks (cooking, cleaning, childcare) collaboratively, challenging traditional gender roles.\n- advice: Be prepared to explain and correct assumptions when living out a collaborative marriage model that differs from cultural expectations.\n- advice: Advocate for biblical collaboration in your context, even through counseling or conversations, reminding others that women are made in God's image and collaboration improves life for everyone.\n- advice: Value relationships even with those who disagree, staying engaged while remaining strong in biblical convictions about mutuality.",
