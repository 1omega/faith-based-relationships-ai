    "content_summary": "Describes the foundational principle of marriage where a man leaves his parents, unites ('holds fast') with his wife, and they become 'one flesh,' signifying a deep, exclusive, and permanent bond.",
    "content_detailed": "This verse establishes the divine pattern for marriage as presented in the creation account: 1) Leaving parental ties to form a new primary relationship ('leave his father and his mother'). 2) Committing with loyalty and devotion to one's spouse ('hold fast to his wife'). 3) Achieving a profound unity that encompasses not just physical union but also unity in purpose, spirit, and life ('they shall become one flesh'). This 'one flesh' union underscores the exclusivity and intended permanence of the marriage covenant, forming a new family unit distinct from the families of origin. Jesus Christ references this verse in Matthew 19:5 and Mark 10:7-8 when teaching against divorce, highlighting its foundational importance in God's design for marriage.",
