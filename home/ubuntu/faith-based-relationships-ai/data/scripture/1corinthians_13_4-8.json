Love never fails.",
    "content_detailed": "This passage from Paul's first letter to the Corinthians provides a foundational Christian definition of love ('agape' in Greek), often cited in the context of relationships. It contrasts love with spiritual gifts, emphasizing that love is superior and essential. The description focuses on love's actions and attitudes: patience and kindness are its active expressions; it lacks negative qualities like envy, boasting, pride, and rudeness; it is selfless, forgiving, and righteous; it endures through all circumstances ('protects, trusts, hopes, perseveres'); and it is eternal ('never fails'). This definition serves as a benchmark for behavior within Christian relationships, including marriage, family, and community.",
