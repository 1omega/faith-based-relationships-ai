    "content_summary": "Begins with mutual submission (v. 21). Instructs wives to submit to their husbands as the church submits to Christ (v. 22-24). Commands husbands to love their wives sacrificially, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, nourishing and cherishing her (v. 25-30). The marriage relationship reflects the mystery of Christ and the church, emphasizing love and respect (v. 31-33).",
    "content_detailed": "This significant passage addresses roles and responsibilities within Christian marriage, framed by the principle of mutual submission \"out of reverence for Christ\" (v. 21). It specifically calls wives to submit to their husbands in everything \"as to the Lord,\" drawing a parallel between the husband's headship and Christ's headship over the church (v. 22-24). The primary and more extensive instruction is directed towards husbands: they are commanded to love their wives with a sacrificial, sanctifying, and selfless love, mirroring Christ's love for the church (v. 25-28). This love involves nourishing and cherishing, just as one cares for their own body, and as Christ cares for the church (v. 29-30). Paul quotes Genesis 2:24 (\"one flesh\") and describes the marital union as a profound mystery that reflects the relationship between Christ and His church (v. 31-32). The passage concludes by summarizing the core responsibilities: the husband is to love his wife as himself, and the wife is to respect her husband (v. 33). Interpretation requires careful consideration of the context, mutual submission, and the nature of Christ's loving headship.",
