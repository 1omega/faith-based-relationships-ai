    "content_summary": "Contrasts the effect of gentle versus harsh communication in conflict: a gentle answer defuses anger (\"turns away wrath\"), while a harsh word escalates it (\"stirs up anger\").",
    "content_detailed": "This proverb offers profound wisdom for managing conflict and interpersonal communication. It highlights the power of tone and word choice in de-escalating or escalating tension. A \"gentle answer\" implies a calm, thoughtful, and considerate response, which has the potential to soothe anger and promote reconciliation. Conversely, a \"harsh word,\" characterized by sharpness, aggression, or cruelty, tends to provoke anger and worsen the conflict. This principle emphasizes self-control, empathy, and the pursuit of peace in interactions, advising against reacting impulsively with anger. It is a practical application of seeking wisdom and understanding in relationships.",
